 German citizens!At the moment of the war when  so it seems  all forces of 
        hate and destruction have been gathered once again, perhaps for the final 
        time, in the west, the east, the southeast, and the south, seeking to break 
        through our front and give the death blow to the Reich, I once again speak 
        to the German people on the eve of 20 April about the Führer, just 
        as I have done every year since 1933. That has happened at good and bad 
        times in the past. But never before did things stand on such a knife’s 
        edge, never before did the German people have to defend their very lives 
        under such enormous danger, never before did the Reich have to draw on 
        its last strength to protect its threatened self.Times such as these are rare in history. They are unique and unparalleled 
        for the fighting generation that must survive them. Historical events 
        of similar nature and extent fade in our memory under the pain that we 
        bear, under the sorrows that almost overwhelm us, under tortured questions 
        about our own future and that of our brave, sorely-tested people...This is not the time to speak of the Führer’s birthday in the usual 
        way or to present him with the usual best wishes. More must be said today, 
        and by one who was won the right both from the Führer and the people. 
        I have been at the Führer’s side for more than twenty years. I have 
        seen his rise and that of his movement from the smallest and most improbable 
        beginnings up to the seizure of power, and gave my best efforts to them 
        as well. I have shared joy and sorrow with the Führer, from unprecedented 
        historic victories to the terrible setbacks in the remarkable years from 
        1939 until now. I stand beside him today as fate challenges him and his 
        people with its last, most severe test. I am confident that fate will 
        give him and his people the laurel wreath of victory. The fact that Germany 
        yet lives, that Europe and the civilized world have not yet fallen into 
        the dark abyss that looms before us, is thanks to him alone.He will be the man of this century  who was sure of himself despite 
        terrible pain and suffering  who showed the way to victory. He is 
        the only one who remained true to himself, who did not cheaply sell his 
        faith and his ideals, who always and without doubt followed his straight 
        path toward his goal. That goal may today be hidden behind the piles of 
        rubble that our hate-filled enemies have wrought across our once-proud 
        continent, but which will once again shine before our burning eyes once 
        the rubble has been cleared.Times like those we experience today demand more of a leader than insight, 
        wisdom, and drive. They demand a toughness and endurance, a steadfastness 
        of heart and soul, that appear only rarely in history, but that when 
        they do appear produce the most admirable achievements of human genius. 
        Burkhardt said in his Who can deny that only the Führer has the right to feel these words 
        apply to him and his deeds in our and many coming generations? What can 
        enemy statesmen say in response? They have nothing but superior numbers, 
        their stupid and insane destructiveness and their diabolical lust for 
        annihilation, behind which lurk the chaos of the collapse of civilized 
        humanity. What has come of their loud and emotional theses of happiness, 
        what of their Atlantic Charter and their Four Freedoms? Only hunger, misery, 
        pestilence, and mass death. A whole raped part of the earth cries out against 
        them. Once flourishing cities and villages in every nation of Europe have 
        been transformed into fields of craters, and hundreds of thousands, even 
        millions of women and children in the north, east, and southeast of the 
        continent sigh and weep under the raging scourge of Bolshevism.The most shining culture the earth has ever seen sinks in ruins and leaves 
        only memories of the greatness of an age destroyed by satanic powers. 
        The peoples are shaken by the most severe economic and social crises, 
        which are but foretastes of the terrible events to come. Our enemies claim 
        that the Führer’s soldiers marched as conquerors through the lands 
        of Europe  but wherever they came, they brought prosperity and happiness, 
        peace, order, reliable conditions, a plenitude of work, and therefore 
        a decent life. Our enemies claim their soldiers came to the same lands 
        as liberators  but wherever they come there is poverty and misery, 
        chaos, devastation and destruction, unemployment, hunger and mass death. 
        And what remains of their so-called freedom is a life that no one would 
        dare call decent even in the darkest corners of Africa. Here is a clear broad outline of a program of construction that has proved 
        itself useful, humane and beneficial, positive and forward-looking, in 
        its own as well as in all the other lands of Europe. It stands against 
        the fantasies of Jewish-Plutocratic-Bolshevist destruction. Here stands 
        a man, sure of himself, having a clear and firm will, against the unnatural 
        coalition of enemy statesmen who are only the lackeys and tools of this 
        world conspiracy. Europe once had the choice between these two. It chose 
        concealed anarchy, and must today pay for its mistake with million-fold 
        agony. It will not have much time any more to choose its fate a second 
        time. It is a matter of life or death!A British newspaper wrote a few days ago that the result of the insane 
        policies of the enemy powers would surely be a revolution of the European 
        peoples against the Anglo-American plutocracy, and that Hitler was the 
        man who was hindered by the same plutocracy through an unholy alliance 
        with Asiatic Bolshevism as he began to bring Europe political and economic 
        happiness. That is how it is, and nothing can whitewash our plutocratic 
        enemies of their crimes.Opposing this apparently all-powerful coalition of destructive satanic 
        forces brings with it tests and burdens of superhuman nature, but that 
        is not dishonorable  the opposite in fact! To bravely accept a battle 
        that is unavoidable and inescapable, to wage it in the name of divine 
        providence, to have confidence in it and its eventual blessing, to stand 
        before fate with a pure conscience and clean hands, to bear all suffering 
        and every test, never even thinking of being untrue to one’s historic 
        mission, never wavering even in the most difficult hours of the final 
        battle  that is not only manly, it is also German in the best sense 
        of the word! Would our people not accept this task and not fight for it 
        as if it were the word of god, it would not deserve to live any longer, 
        and would lose any possibility of further life.What we experience today is the last act of a powerful drama that began 
        on 1 August 1914 and which we Germans gave up on on 9 November 1918 just 
        before the end. That is why we had to begin again on 1 September 1939. 
        What we hoped to spare ourselves in November 1918 we have paid for two- 
        or threefold today. There is no escape  unless the German people 
        surrenders any kind of decent human life and is ready to forever live 
        in a way that would shame even the most primitive African tribes.If it is manly and German as Führer of a great and brave people 
        to depend wholly on oneself in this struggle, relying on one’s own own 
        strength and certainty as well as the help of god in the face of an enemy 
        who threatens with overwhelming numbers, to fight rather than to capitulate, 
        then it is just as manly and German for a people to follow such a Führer, 
        unconditionally and loyally, without excuse or reservation, to shake off 
        all feelings of weakness and uncertainty, to trust in the good star that 
        is above him and us all. This is all the more true when that star at times 
        is covered by a black cloud. Misfortune must not make us cowardly, but 
        rather resistant, never giving a mocking watching world the appearance 
        of wavering. Rather than hoisting the white flag of surrender that the 
        enemy expects, raise the old swastika banner of a fanatic and wild resistance, 
        renewing the oath that we swore so often in the happy and safe days of 
        peace, thanking god again and again that he gave us a true leader for 
        these terrible times, feeling bound in our hearts to his sorrows and trials, 
        thus showing the enemy world that they can wound but not kill us, that 
        they can beat us bloody but not force us down, torture us, but not demoralize 
        us!Is there a single German who disagrees? After six years of battle, could 
        our people debase itself so low as to forget honor and duty, surrendering 
        in the turmoil of the moment its holy and inalienable right to its great 
        future for a pot of soup? Who would dare suggest that? Who holds 
        us in such contempt that he believes that now, just as we stand before 
        the final and decisive round of the war, we would be untrue to all our 
        sworn ideals, that we would throw all our hopes for the future of our 
        Reich overboard, giving up in the midst of the confusion of misfortune 
        that has overcome us on ourselves, our land and people, and the lives of 
        our children and children’s children?The world speaks of loyalty as a German virtue. How could our people 
        have withstood the tests of this war without it, and how could it survive 
        the war’s coming end without it? For it is ending! The war is nearing 
        its end. The insanity that the enemy powers of unleashed on humanity has 
        gone beyond all bounds. The whole world feels only shame and disgust. 
        The perverse coalition between plutocracy and Bolshevism is collapsing! 
        Fate has taken the head of the enemy conspiracy Once more the armies of the enemy powers storm against our defensive 
        fronts. Behind them is the slavering force of International Jewry that 
        wants no peace until it has reached its satanic goal of world destruction. 
        But its hopes are in vain! As he has done so often before, god will throw 
        Lucifer back into the abyss even as he stands before the gates of power 
        over all the peoples. A man of truly timeless greatness, of unique courage, 
        of a steadfastness that elevates the hearts of some and shakes those of 
        others, will be his tool. Who will maintain that this man can be found 
        in the leadership of Bolshevism or plutocracy? No, the German people bore 
        him. It chose him, it by free election made him Führer. It knows 
        his works of peace and now wants to bear and fight the war that was forced 
        upon him until its successful end.Within a few years after the war, Germany will flourish as never before. 
        Its ruined landscapes and provinces will be filled with new, more beautiful 
        cities and villages in which happy people dwell. All of Europe will share 
        in this prosperity. We will again be friends of all peoples of good will, 
        and will work together with them to repair the grave wounds that scar 
        the face of our noble continent. Our daily bread will grow on rich fields 
        of grain, stilling the hunger of the millions who today suffer and starve. 
        There will be jobs in plenitude, the deepest source of human happiness, 
        from which will come blessing and strength for all. Chaos will vanish. 
        The underworld will not rule this part of the world, but rather order, 
        peace, and prosperity.That was always our goal! It is our goal today. If the enemy powers had 
        their way, humanity would drown in a sea of blood and tears. War would 
        follow war and revolution would follow revolution, finally destroying 
        the last remnants of a world that was once beautiful and lovely, and that 
        will be so again.But if we achieve our goals, the project of social construction begun 
        in Germany in 1933 and was rudely interrupted in 1939 will be taken up 
        again with renewed strength. Other peoples will join in  not because 
        we force them to, but rather of their own free will  because there is 
        no other way out of the world crisis. Who could show the way save the 
        Führer! His work is the work of order. His enemies have only a devil’s 
        work of anarchy and devastation to set against his work.German history is not rich in great statesmen. But where one has appeared 
        he usually had something to say and give not only to his own people, but 
        to the world. What would there be European about Europe had not German 
        kaisers and kings, counts and generals and their armies repeatedly withstood 
        the onslaughts from the east! Usually only a disunited continent stood 
        behind them that either did not understood or even fell upon Germany in 
        the midst of its saving work for Europe. Why should it be any different 
        today? At the present state of things, which the war is just before, or 
        perhaps even in the midst of, a peripeteia, it is difficult to understand 
        this great battle between peoples. One thing, however, can no longer be 
        disputed: If there had been no Adolf Hitler, if Germany had been led by 
        a government like those in Finland, Bulgaria, or Rumania, it would long 
        since have become the prey of Bolshevism. Lenin once said the path to 
        world revolution leads though Poland and the Reich. Poland is already 
        in the possession of the Kremlin, despite all the attempts of the Anglo-Americans 
        to conceal it. If Germany had followed, or would follow, what would become 
        of the rest of our continent?To ask the question is to answer it. The Soviets would probably already 
        be at the Atlantic coast, and England sooner or later would receive its 
        just reward for its betrayal of Europe that finds its most wretched expression 
        in its marriage with Bolshevism. In the United States too, one would soon 
        think differently of the dreadful world phenomenon that a Jewish press 
        entirely and fully conceals from the American public.If the world still lives, and not only our world but the rest of it as 
        well, whom has it to thank other than the Führer? It may defame and 
        slander him today, persecuting him with its base hatred, but it will have 
        to revise this standpoint or bitterly regret it! He is the core of resistance 
        to the collapse of the world. He is Germany’s bravest heart and our people’s 
        most passionate will. I permit myself to make a judgment that must be 
        made today: If the nation still breaths, if it still has the chance of 
        victory, if there is still an escape from the deadly danger it faces  
        it is thanks to him. He is steadfastness itself. I have never seen him 
        fail or falter, or weaken or tire. He will go his way to the end, and 
        there awaits not the end of his people, but rather a new and happy beginning 
        to an era in which Germandom will flourish as never before.Listen, Germans! Millions of people look to this man from every land 
        on the earth, still doubting and questioning whether he knows the way 
        out of the great misfortune that has befallen the world. He will show 
        the peoples that way, but we look to him full of hope and with a deep, 
        unshakable faith. We stand behind him with fortitude and courage: soldier 
        and civilian, man, woman and child  a people determined to do all 
        to defend its life and honor. He may look his enemies in the eye, for 
        we promise him that he does not need to look behind him. We will not waver 
        or weaken. We will never desert him, no matter how desperate and dangerous 
        the hour. We stand with him, as he stands with us  in Germanic loyalty 
        as we have sworn, as we shall fulfill. We do not need to tell him, for 
        he knows and must know: Führer command!  We will follow! We 
        feel him in us and around us. God give him strength and health and preserve 
        him from every danger. We will do the rest.Our misfortune has made us mature, but not robbed us of our character. 
        Germany is still the land of loyalty. It will celebrate its greatest triumphs 
        in the midst of danger. Never will history record that in these days a 
        people deserted its Führer or a Führer deserted his people. 
        And that is victory. We have often wished the Führer in happy times 
        our best on this evening. Today in the midst of suffering and danger, 
        our greeting is much deeper and more profound. May he remain what he is 
        to us and always was  Our Hitler!
