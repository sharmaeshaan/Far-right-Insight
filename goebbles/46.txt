 So wrote the correspondent of the English newspaper According to Lady Asquith, the wife of the then English Prime

      Minister, this war reporter, who meanwhile had advanced to First

      Lord of the Admiralty, responded to the outbreak of the World

      War with cheerful laughter. During a speech in Dundee, a woman

      from the gallery yelled: “You’ve never told the truth. The

      truth is a stranger to you.” He introduced the phase “terminological

      inexactitude” to the world, a discreet way of avoiding the

      rather crude word “lie.” He resorts regularly to the

      phrase when he is caught in an untruth. His swindles are world-renowned.

      The English battleship “Audacious” was sunk on 27 October

      1914. Not only did he deny the fact, he even published falsified

      pictures of a sister ship of the “Audacious” with this

      caption: “The ‘Audacious’ returns to the fleet.” As

      early as 1900 he wrote in one of his books: “I then had

      no idea what a great and undoubtedly useful role deceit plays

      in the life of those nations that enjoy democratic freedom.”The reader will already have guessed whom we are speaking

      of. It is Mr. Winston Churchill, W.C. in short, currently the

      English prime minister and the first violin in the hellish concert

      that the whole demo-plutocratic world is playing against the

      Axis powers.It is not easy to give a character sketch of this man who

      lacks all character. He is one of those political chameleons

      who can change his color as needed and his opinions a thousand

      times, and makes energetic use of these abilities. He lies not

      only out of necessity, but for the sheer pleasure of it, for

      it is part of him. As one leading English newspaper wrote after

      the bitter experiences of the World War, he is a political juggler

      who unfortunately always leads his country in the wrong direction.One must know Churchill if he is to understand England’s present

      policies and military leadership. They, like he, are wholly without

      direction or plan, an endless chain of actions and improvisations

      that now and again seem to prosper at first, but in the end regularly

      just miss success.Last spring, for example, Mr. Churchill had the crazy idea

      of occupying Norway. The Führer beat him to it by a nose,

      which has not stopped him from claiming a brilliant success.

      The German army threw the British troops out of Norway in a glorious

      victory. Mr. Churchill nonetheless gave a speech to the survivors

      of the British destroyers “Hardy” and “Ellipse”

      in which he said: “You are the forefront of the army that

      we will use in the course of the summer to cleanse Norway of

      the dreadful filth of Nazi tyranny.”Everyone knows what actually happened. England had to be content

      to save the last remnants of its defeated divisions from Western

      Europe. It stopped talking about a renewed occupation of Norway.

      But that did not trouble Churchill. He had been through it during

      the World War with his disastrous Gallipoli invasion. He had

      walked through streams of English blood and become hard to the

      sentiments that might have affected anyone else after such a

      catastrophe. His cynicism about a war that affects millions of

      human lives is unparalleled. His autobiography has an interesting

      passage comparing the wars in India to a proper European war:

      “The suppression of the poor Indians could hardly be compared

      to a proper European war. It was like a paper chase rather than

      racing in a real derby. Well, one has to take what the age offers.”That is how Churchill loves and lives. One has to see a current

      photograph of his face to grasp the true depravity of plutocracy.

      This face has not a single good characteristic. It is marked

      by cynicism. The ice-cold eyes are free of any emotion. This

      man strides over corpses to feed his blind and limitless personal

      egotism. The cigar butt in his mouth is the last sign of a lifestyle

      that has outlived its time. The English Labor leader Lansbury

      wrote about him in the We have nothing to add to that. England will one day pay a heavy price 
        for this man. When the great catastrophe breaks over the island kingdom, 
        the British people will have him to thank. He has long been the spokesman 
        for the plutocratic caste that wanted war to destroy Germany. He distinguishes 
        himself from the men behind the scenes only through his obvious cynicism 
        and his unscrupulous contempt for humankind. He wants war for war’s sake. 
        War is an end in itself to him. He wished it, pushed for it, and prepared 
        for it out of a stupid, destructive drive. He is one of those characters 
        of the political underworld who rise through chaos, who announce chaos, 
        who cause chaos. For countless people the war brings vast suffering, for 
        countless children hunger and disease, for countless mothers and women 
        streams of tears. For him, it is no more than a big horse race that he 
        wants to take part in.He now has what he wanted. England is in the middle of the gravest struggle 
        in its history, from which it will be lucky to emerge with its mere existence. 
        The big race has begun, and he who wanted it so much is the English prime 
        minister. He will not be able to escape the crucial hour. When Chamberlain 
        was his superior, he could duck ultimate responsibility. No longer. He 
        must stand and fight.It does not surprise us that he is fighting to some extent.

      No one can escape his character, not even Mr. Churchill. He loses

      himself in feverish fantasies and confuses dreams without the

      shadow of truth with reality. In situations from which there

      is no escape he resorts to mystic-sounding phases. His outbursts

      against the Reich and the Führer display ordinary gutter

      language that is usually rejected even by warring enemies. He

      spits out insults against the German people in his impotent rage.

      In all this we see him without any mask, a caricature of John

      Bull, a toothless bully, a monstrosity born of filth and fire

      that one must render harmless if the world is to have peace.England’s tragic fate is that it is led by him and has tied

      its fate to his. He was the one who persuaded Great Britain to

      ignore its historic opportunity and take the rapid path to its

      downfall. When the history of the fall of the island kingdom

      is one day written, the title of the critical chapter will have

      to be “Churchill.”It is always good to see a tyrannical system embodied in one man. That 
        is the case here. That makes our attack easy. At least we know where we 
        are. Churchill  that means war, as long as he is around. He never 
        wanted anything else, and will never be able to want anything else.Well, now he has it, as does the nation that must fight and suffer. He 
        will fall with the war and through it, and on his grave will be the millions 
        of curses of those he has seduced. That and only that is what England 
        has deserved.
