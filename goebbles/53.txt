 The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, as is well known,

      is a close friend of alcohol. His relations to the truth are

      a bit more strained. He has been on a war footing ever since

      his entry into political life. He is one of the world’s best

      known liars. Not only do those in neutral and enemy nations smile

      when he says something, even knowledgeable circles in England

      cannot repress a grin. Everyone knows how he adds or subtracts,

      for example. At the moment he divides figures that are unfavorable

      for England by three, and multiplies the favorable ones by the

      same figure.The multiplier or divisor varies according to the war situation.

      When Mr. Churchill was recently forced to give an account of

      the Battle of the Atlantic to the House of Commons, he announced

      that 750,000 BRT had been sunk in the preceding four months.

      The real figure was 2 million. Granted, he can claim to be less

      than a liar than Stalin. The latter recently said that 378,000

      Soviet soldiers were missing, while we happen to have 3,600,000

      Bolshevist prisoners. He uses a divisor of ten.It is clear that the enemy does not hesitate to tell the most

      outrageous lies, even when we possess irrefutable and persuasive

      numerical evidence. They clearly are not trying to impress us

      with their figures any longer. The sole goal is a more or less

      short-term impact on world opinion. They no longer have the courage

      to tell the whole truth, since they begin to realize that it

      could be a shock to domestic public opinion that could not be

      controlled. They conceal the facts without particularly worrying

      about us. That’s how things are at the moment in the Moscow-London-Washington

      coalition.Questions are increasingly being asked in England as to how,

      given the current situation, England has any chance at all of

      winning. Mr. Churchill did indeed claim with practiced emotion

      during his last speech that if Japan and the United States began

      warfare, a British declaration of war would follow within the

      hour. Everyone knows that that is a bluff. How can an England

      that daily sends desperate pleas to the U.S. provide any support?

      Great Britain’s current situation is so hopeless that only a

      miracle can save it. Mr. Churchill’s prophecies have not been

      fulfilled. The Soviet Union has not done what was expected of

      it. The Battle of the Atlantic continues with consequences that

      in the long run can only be fatal for England. The threat of

      a blockade of the Axis powers has failed. Roosevelt is running

      into war with seven league boots, but he may not make it, and

      even if he does, how would America’s entry change England’s precarious

      situation?The English government clearly must maintain face even in

      its present desperate situation. One cannot determine the dramatic

      change in England’s changes by comparing yesterday to today,

      but if one looks back to the end of June it becomes clear that

      England’s chances are nil. We will not even mention the alleged

      plan to invade the continent as a way of taking pressure from

      the Soviets, even if London was speaking about it four months

      ago as if it were practically a given. It has been removed from

      consideration on the other side of the Channel, and by the same

      Prime Minister who not too long ago was encouraging his paid

      journalists to promote it.When the Führer spoke with biting irony of this empty prattle in 
        his recent Munich speech, the English press hurriedly sought to avoid 
        the matter, explaining that the Führer’s speech really did not say 
        anything new and therefore did not deserve a detailed response. In the 
        previous 24 hours, however, the British air force lost 60 valuable aircraft 
        and 250 crewmen in flights over the Reich or our occupied territories. 
        During the same period we had seven civilian deaths and no significant 
        damage. The human casualties thus stand in a relationship of 1:36. The 
        material losses are hardly comparable. Mr. Churchill blamed the enormous 
        losses by the Royal Air Force on the weather, which his news service claimed 
        was the worst in 98 years. It seems the British have been keeping exact 
        records of weather conditions in Germany for the last 98 years  
        one must be orderly, after all. He also raised the number of participating 
        aircraft over a period of 72 hours from 150 to 2,000, to lower the loss 
        percentages. But the American press reported the next day that the Royal 
        Air Force lost nearly half of the aircraft involved in the mission.Do what one will, England has nothing left but a bitter aftertaste.

      They have miscalculated in every regard. There is no revolution

      in Germany or the occupied regions. The blockade has been rendered

      useless by Germany’s counter-blockade. The current situation

      rules out a return to the continent. The so-called “Non-Stop

      Offensive” has not come anywhere close to living up to its

      promise. We no longer fear assistance from the U.S.A. Despite

      all the prayers of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bolshevist

      offensive has failed. London’s numerous psychological attempts

      to break Axis unity were condemned to failure from the beginning.

      British attempts to break German morale have failed. Once more:

      How is it possible for England to win at all, or even better

      put, how is it possible for it to avoid losing?We are not among those who fantasize about a collapse of the

      British Empire in the next day or two. All good things take time

      and that which has been built up over centuries will not collapse

      in a few months. We see things realistically, and know that it

      take more blows before the pompous colossus begins to crumble. But

      that is not really important. What is important is that fact

      that England no longer has a chance to win, and is in fact already

      on the road to defeat.No one can say exactly when that will happen. We are not waging

       war with a stopwatch. Mr. Churchill makes childish claims

      every day over his propaganda service that if we have not won

      the war by a certain point, we will lose it. It is true that

      the British and American armaments industries are producing at

      full capacity, but does Mr. Churchill believe that our factories

      and those of our allies are idle? We hardly believe that time

      is working in England’s favor. We know exactly what England can

      and cannot do. We also know what we cannot do, and above all

      what we can do. We also have firm figures that give us a reliable

      grasp of our armaments capacities and those of the enemy. Mr.

      Churchill may be able to fool his satellites with his figures,

      but we will never be in any doubt as to which multiplier or divisor

      we need to apply to his numbers.Incidentally, both the recent and distant past provide ample evidence 
        that one must distinguish between England’s claims and the facts. What 
        they announce or threaten usually proves empty. Their boasting as a result 
        has no effect on us. They hardly cause us the fright Mr. Churchill seems 
        to expect, but rather give only the occasion to smile. London cannot fool 
        us. We know what a desperate situation the British Empire is in just as 
        well as Mr. Churchill  perhaps even better than he.The only remaining question is why he stubbornly and insistently holds 
        to a position that is so harmful for England. In recent weeks there have 
        been rumors of German peace-feelers. The wish is the father of the thought. 
        He has to give his people something to strengthen their resolve. When 
        he bombastically announces that he will never accept a German peace offer 
         an offer that we have not made and will never make  it is 
        only grasping at straws as a way of dealing with his inferiority complex. 
        We do not consider him a person with a political conscience. He has no 
        scruples at all and his hide is as thick as that of a hippopotamus. He 
        is wholly indifferent to the vast misery into which he has plunged the 
        nations he has seduced. He is also incapable of historical thinking, as 
        his speeches regularly prove. He who joins forces with Bolshevism to lay 
        waste to Europe is a man without character who is hostile to Europe.He really is not interested in such things. He evaluates everything

      only as to how it affects his valued self. He prepared this war

      and incited it. In the fullest sense of the word, it is his war.

      If England loses the war his position will also collapse, and

      perhaps more fully than he is able to realize today. That may

      be why he has made repeated attempts recently to place the responsibility

      for the war elsewhere. In his more lucid moments he probably

      sees his approaching fate but does not want to admit it. He fights

      desperately, hoping for a miracle.He will wait in vain. History also has its laws. They can sometimes be 
        slowed down, but never stopped. Fate follows its prescribed course. It 
        will not stop at England’s door. We do not know when the hour will come. 
        Rather than asking when, we should work and fight for it so that it will 
        find us a nation in readiness.
