 In the minister’s office there is a long map table in front of the window 
        facing the Wilhelmplatz. Some maps are of the sort on which General Staff 
        officers measure with their compasses and sketch their plans. There are 
        others that belong to a chapter of the war that is unequaled in the history 
        of warfare.One map shows the radio transmitters that have been conquered

      in Europe. Another shows on numerous pages the movements and

      locations of the propaganda companies. A world map shows the

      zones reached by shortwave transmissions in many languages. Still

      another shows the movements and performances of front theater

      companies. Another compares the cities in England and Germany

      that have been bombed. Whenever Dr. Goebbels meets with officers,

      war reporters, editors, radio people, and artists around the table,

      the ways the war has mobilized the spirit and the soul become

      evident.Once or twice each week the room is empty, and Dr. Goebbels

      wanders around the table. He dictates an article or a speech.

      This is in the middle of the day’s work, and often happens so

      quickly that those in the waiting room are surprised when the

      stenographer leaves after only fifteen minutes. There have been

      days of such high tension and concentration that he has dictated

      a three column article in twelve minutes. But that is not the

      rule. When Dr. Goebbels polemicizes, he does so in a way few

      others can equal. He dictates sharp and pointed phrases, as well

      as ones that are elegant and powerful. He needs no long preparation.

      As a revolutionary, he is at ease with all forms of political

      eloquence. As a result, most of these articles read as if they

      had just been spoken. His essays that treat the great problems

      of the day or have a particular foreign policy aim, are different.

      Such pieces are written with the requisite thoroughness. Files

      and evidence are gathered, quotations checked against the original,

      quotations from Eden or Roosevelt or Pitman or Ickes are double-checked.

      When a manuscript has been worked over numerous times it may

      be set aside for a week or longer, after which every word is

      once more weighed. A war cannot be won by temperament alone,

      even temperament as great as Dr. Goebbels has. Few know that

      he follows a stringent daily plan. He begins each day with the

      diary he has kept since 1920, and ends late in the night with

      a preview of the footage for the next newsreel, 3,000 copies

      of which will go out to all the world.The precise daily routine was harder and harder to follow as the first 
        signs of a real danger of war in Europe began to appear. That was a few 
        months after the Munich Conference, December/January of 1938/39. England 
        was arming, the United States opened its press and diplomacy to incitement, 
        France was drawn in, Poland was driven down the path to insanity. It became 
        essential to be propagandistically alert and to show our own people as 
        well as those of the world what was happening. The ministry needed to 
        prepare the radio, the press, film, and the party for whatever might come. 
        German propaganda was preparing for its baptism by fire.Dr. Goebbels held to his daily routine. The trivial was shoved aside. 
        Visitors had to be more concise. The documents and proposals that reached 
        his desk became even briefer. But more time was given to reading the press 
        and confidential news, enemy leaflets and brochures, and the transcripts 
        of foreign radio stations. The minister’s work room became once more like 
        his editorial office in the years he was fighting for Berlin, but now 
        he was no longer leading a newspaper, but rather the entire news system, the 
        radio, oral propaganda, and brochures.These changed circumstances once again testified to his journalistic 
        abilities. Everything that Dr. Goebbels heard or read was transformed 
        into war leadership. Most matters he passed on to others with a few brief 
        instructions. Much of his dictation appeared abroad, without betraying 
        his name. The emphasis was always on timeliness. Lengthy pamphlets, thick 
        tomes, deep academic discussions of the sort one used during the World 
        War were almost always rejected. The important thing was to keep at the 
        enemy’s heels. There could be no trench warfare in propaganda. Each of 
        Churchill’s blunders, each of his defeats and embarrassments, had to be 
        responded to immediately. Dr. Goebbels commented week after week on the 
        state of things. His essays appeared in the Some ask why he does not direct the entire press. He obviously has the 
        ability. But Dr. Goebbels makes a clear distinction between what he does 
        as minister and what he does as a journalist. As a journalist he does 
        his own work. He wants people to see his articles as his personal opinion. 
        He wants them to have weight, to stand out, to speak to the readers. Political 
        writing, political arguments, and political persuasion stand alongside 
        the news, the dispatches from the army command, the propaganda company 
        reports.His personal writing and speeches come in the midst of his war work. 
        So much has happened in this “unique era “ since the critical 
        year 1939  the achievements of our soldiers and the changes in the 
        map brought about by our campaigns are of such enormous scale that a speech 
        or essay can be forgotten. When however one considers the items collected 
        in this book, which are only a part of what he produced in these years, 
        one is reminded of the scale of the war. They show that we have approached 
        this war as a political people and that we see it as a political whole. 
        We have never lacked something to say. We have avoided high-flown boasting 
        and careless words. There is no sign of a patriotic bombast that conceals 
        the real difficulties and challenges of the war. Dr. Goebbels has also 
        determined where the language should be pointed. He knows and shares the 
        collective and sensible mood of our people. He might speak with biting 
        irony about men like Churchill or Halifax, Eden or Roosevelt, but never 
        forgot the reality of the enemy’s strength. When he makes predictions 
         and now and again in this book he does  they depend not on 
        careless hopes for a happy accident, the kind of thing Churchill does 
        to conceal from the English the seriousness of their defeats. Instead, 
        he reveals the enemy’s secret intentions and points out their responsibility. 
        For example, what Dr. Goebbels wrote about American warmongers in January 
        1939 has come true step by step.In one of his essays on Churchill, Dr. Goebbels characterized

      him as a gambler who each time hopes his luck will improve, while

      all the while he is gambling away his whole empire. The Führer

      and Mr. Churchill differ most clearly in their relationship to

      luck. This theme appears regularly, always in the only way that

      corresponds to our way of thinking. As Moltke put it, in the

      long run only those are lucky who deserve to be. Miracles and

      luck will not decide this war. Victory will depend on the achievements

      of our people, on our weapons and on the resoluteness of our

      hearts, against which all the words of the enemy are in vain.

      In a language that the educated and the uneducated can understand,

      Dr. Goebbels has expressed the war doctrine of a young socialist

      people, a people that knows that everything that happens follows

      a higher necessity. That is the essence of the war. No hope or

      waiting, no renunciation or obligation is in vain. Nothing unnecessary

      is asked of us, no drop of blood is shed for reasons of prestige.

      Everything follows a secret plan in the hands of the Führer.

      This sum of these essays and speeches makes clear the logic of

      the war. It depends on a consciousness of German security and

      superiority. Our whole thinking in this war is contained in this

      one sentence: “Germany has always been as strong as it is

      today, but never knew it.”
