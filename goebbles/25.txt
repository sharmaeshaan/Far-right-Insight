 In the beginning of August, this year, one of the most authoritative 
        English newspapers published a leading article entitled “Two Dictatorships”, 
        in which a naive and misdirected attempt was made to place before the 
        readers of the paper certain alleged similarities between Russian Bolshevism 
        and German National Socialism. This article gave rise to an extraordinary 
        amount of heated discussion in international centres, which was only another 
        proof of the fact that an astonishing misconception exists among the most 
        prominent West European circles as to the danger which communism presents 
        to the life of the individual and of the nation. Such people still cling 
        to their opinion in face of the terrible and devastating experiences of 
        the past eighteen years in Russia.The author of the article stated that the two symbols which

      are to-day opposed to one another, namely that of Bolshevism

      and National Socialism, stand for regimes which “in essential

      structure are similar and in many of their laws-their buttresses-are

      identical. The similarity is moreover increasing.” He went

      on to say:“In both countries are the same censorships on art, literature,

      and of course the Press, the same war on the intelligentsia,

      the attack on religion, and the massed display of arms, whether

      in the Red Square or the Tempelhofer Feld.”“The strange and terrible thing is”, he declared,

      “that two nations, once so widely different, should have

      been schooled and driven into patterns so drably similar.”One sees here much verbiage and little understanding. The

      anonymous writer of this article has obviously not studied the

      essential and fundamental principles either of National Socialism

      or Bolshevism. He considers merely certain superficial phenomena

      and he has not taken cognisance of what serious journalists have

      had to say on the matter in question or compared his views with

      their objective statements. This entirely erroneous judgment

      of the case might be passed over with a shrug of the shoulders

      and considered merely as part of the daily order of things, were

      it not for the fact that the two problems here discussed belong

      in their essentials to political phenomena which are important

      for the future of Europe. Moreover this strikingly cursory judgment

      on the problem is not merely a single case but has to be taken

      in conjunction with a much wider and more influential section

      of West European opinion.In contradistinction to this, I shall try here to analyse

      Bolshevism into its basic elements and show these as clearly

      as I can to the German and European public. This is not an easy

      task, in view of the fact that the Propagandist Institutions

      of the Communist International are undoubtedly well organised

      and have not been unsuccessful in putting before the public of

      the world, outside of the Russian frontiers, an entirely false

      picture of Bolshevism. This picture is an extraordinarily dangerous

      one because of the tension which it can and must naturally cause.

      Let us also note the profound hatred in liberal circles throughout

      the world in regard to National Socialism and its practical constructive

      work in Germany. Hence the possibility here also of mistaken

      judgments, such as these already mentioned. They pass by what

      is essential. International communism would entirely do away

      with all national and racial qualities which are founded in human

      nature itself; in property it sees the most primary cause of

      the break-down of world trade in the capitalist system. Accordingly

      it exploits this through an extensive and carefully organised

      and brutal system of action, setting aside personal values and

      sacrificing the individual to a hollow mass-idol that is only

      a travesty of actual life itself. At the same time it ignores

      and destroys all the idealistic and higher strivings of men and

      nations, through its own crass and empty materialist principles.

      On the other hand, National Socialism sees in all these thingsin

      property, in personal values and in nation and race and the principles

      of idealismthese forces which carry on every human civilisation

      and fundamentally determine its worth.Bolshevism is explicitly determined on bringing about a revolution

      among all the nations. In its own essence it has an aggressive

      and international tendency. But National Socialism confines itself

      to Germany and is not a product for export, either in its abstract

      or practical characteristics. Bolshevism denies religion as a

      principle, fundamentally and entirely. It recognises religion

      only as an “opium for the people.” For the help and

      support of religious belief, however, National Socialism absolutely

      places in the foreground of its programme a belief in God and

      that transcendental idealism which has been destined by Nature

      to bring to expression the racial soul of a nation. National

      Socialism would give the lead in a new concept and shaping of

      European civilisation. But the Bolshevics carry on a campaign,

      directed by the Jews, with the international underworld, against

      culture as such. Bolshevism is not merely anti-bourgeois; it

      is against human civilisation itself.In its final consequences it signifies the destruction of

      all the commercial, social, political and cultural achievements

      of Western Europe, in favour of a deracinated and nomadic international

      cabal which has found its representation in Judaism. This grandiose

      attempt to overthrow the civilised world is so much more dangerous

      in its effects because the Communist International, which is

      a past master in the art of misrepresentation, has been able

      to find its protectors and pioneers among a great part of these

      intellectual circles in Europe whose physical and spiritual destruction

      much be the first result of a Bolshevic world revolution.Bolshevism, which is in reality an attack on the world of

      the spirit, pretends to be intellectual itself. Where circumstances

      demand, it comes as a wolf in sheep’s clothing. But underneath

      the false mask which it here and there assumes there are always

      the satanic forces of world destruction. And where it has had

      the opportunity of practising its theories it has created “The

      Paradise of the Workers and Peasants”, in the shape of a

      fearful desert of starving and hungering people. If we are to

      take the word of its doctrine then we find a terrible contradiction

      between its theory and its practice. Its theory is glowing and

      grandiose but it carries poison in its attractive gloss. Over

      against this, what we have from it in reality is terrible and

      forbidding. This is shown in the millions of sacrifices which

      have been made in honour of it, through executions with the sword,

      the axe or the hangman’s rope or hunger. Its teaching promises

      “the fatherland of the workers and peasants”, which

      shall know no frontiers, and a classless social order which will

      be protected against exploitation through the state, and it preaches

      an economic principle in which “everything belongs to everybody”

      and that thereby a real and universal world peace will be ushered

      in.Millions of workers on hunger-wages such as are not thought

      of in western Europe, millions of afflicted and sorrowing peasants

      who have been robbed of their land, which is being completely

      ruined by the stupid experiment of a paralysing collectivism,

      famine which claims millions of victims year after year in a

      country of such vast extent that it might serve as a granary

      for the whole of Europe, the formation and equipping of an army

      which, according to the claims of all leading Bolshevists, is

      to be used for carrying out the world revolution, the brutal

      and merciless domination of this madly-led apparatus of State

      and Party at the hands of a small terrorist minority which is

      mostly Jewishall this speaks another language, a language which

      the world cannot listen to permanently because it rings with

      the story of nameless suffering and indescribable hardships borne

      by a nation of a hundred-and-sixty million people.The fact that, in order to carry out its aims, Bolshevism

      uses propagandist methods which are perceptible only by those

      which have experience in such things and are entirely accepted

      in good faith by the average citizen makes this Terror International

      extraordinarily dangerous for other states and peoples. This

      propaganda starts out from the principle that the end sanctifies

      the means, that lies and slander, the terrorising of the individual

      and of the mass, robbery and burnings and strikes and insurrection,

      espionage and sabotage of armies can and ought to be made use

      of, and therewith that the aim of revolutionising the whole world

      must be specially and solely kept in view. This extraordinarily

      pernicious method of influencing the masses of the people does

      not stop before anything or anybody. Those alone are competent

      to deal with it who see into its secret driving forces and are

      capable of adopting the necessary contrary measures. This propaganda

      understands how to adopt every instrument to its purpose. It

      takes on an intellectual shape in intellectual circles. It is

      bourgeois with the bourgeoisie and proletarian with the proletariat.

      It is mild and passive where that attitude suits and it is pugnacious

      wherever it meets opposition that needs to be suppressed.Bolshevism carries on its International propaganda through

      the Komintern.A few weeks ago this apparatus for world destruction made

      public to the whole of Europe its plan of campaign for the annihilation

      of the nations and the states, all arranged and set forth in

      its tactical and strategical elements. Yet the bourgeois world,

      whose extirpation was announced openly and without any reserve

      whatsoever, failed to make any public protest of indignation

      and unite all the forces at its command as a definite counter-defence.The cry of warning was raised only by those states in which

      Bolshevism has been finally overcome through the restoration

      of national principles. But this cry of warning was laughed at

      by the threatened bourgeois world and set aside as an exaggerated

      alarm.Swept clear of internal enemies and united under the National

      Socialist standard, Germany placed herself at the head of the

      groups marshalled in the fight against the international bolshevisation

      of the world. Herein she is quite aware that she is fulfilling

      a world mission which reaches out beyond all national frontiers.

      On the successful issue of this mission depends the fate of our

      civilised nations. As National Socialists, we have seen Bolshevism

      through and through. We recognise it beneath all its masks and

      camouflages. It stands before us derobed of its trappings, bare

      and naked in its whole miserable imposture. We know what its

      teachings are, but we know also what it is in practice.Here I shall give an unvarnished picture, which is backed

      up in all particulars by incontestable facts. If there is a spark

      of reason left in the world, and the faculty for clear thinking,

      then the states and peoples must be shocked at the prospect and

      induced to come together for their common defence against this

      acute danger.I leave the methods and practices of the Communist Propaganda

      and theory within and without Russia to speak through examples

      which appear to me to be symptomatic. These examples could be

      replaced and supplemented by thousands of others, all of which

      when taken together show up the terrible aspect of this world

      disease.Murder of individuals, murder of hostages and mass murder

      are the favourite means applied by Bolshevism to get rid of all

      opposition to its propaganda.In Germany three hundred National Socialists fell victims

      to the Communist terror practised on individuals. On the 14th

      January 1930, Horst Wessel was shot through the half-opened door

      of his house by the Communist, Alberecht Hohler-called Ali-his

      accessories being the Jews, Salli Eppestein and Else Cohn. On

      the 9th of August 1931, the police captains, Anlauf and Lenck,

      were shot down in the Bülowplatz in Berlin. The Communist

      leaders, Heinz Neumann and Kippenberger, were accused as instigators

      of the murder. Shortly afterwards Heinz Neumann was arrested

      in Switzerland because of a passport which was invalid and a

      request for extradition made by Germany was not granted, on the

      plea that it was a “political crime.” These are only

      some single examples of the communist terror wreaked on individuals.

      As further instances of the blood lust and cruelty to which they

      bear evidence we may turn to the hostage murders which took place

      in previous years.On April 30th 1919, in the Courtyard of the Luitpold Gymnasium,

      in Münich, ten hostages, among them a woman, were shot through

      the backs, their bodies rendered unrecognisable and taken away.

      This act was done at the order of the Communist Terrorist, Eglhofer,

      and under the responsibility of the Jewish Soviet Commissaries,

      Levien, Levien-Nissen and Axelrod. In 1919, during the Bolshevic

      regime of the Jew, Bela Kun, whose real name was Aron Cohn, in

      Budapest twenty hostages were murdered. During the October Revolution

      in Spain eight prisoners were shot at Ovièdo, seventeen

      in Turon; and in the barracks at Pelàno, to protect a

      communist attack, thirty-eight prisoners were placed at the head

      of the insurgents and some of them shot. At the Komintern Congress,

      on July 31st, 1935, the communist leader, Carcio, expressly declared

      that this revolution was carried through “under the leadership

      of the communists.”This list of bloodshed becomes all the more fearful and horrible

      when we add to it the apparently incredible number of mass murders

      carried out by the Communists. As a classical prototype of this,

      we have the Paris Commune of the year 1871, which was passionately

      celebrated by Karl Marx and is approved today by modern Soviets

      as the model of the Bolshevic World Revolution. The number of

      victims who fell in that terrible year 1871 can no longer be

      ascertained. The Jewish Tschekist, Bela Kun, made an experiment

      which rivalled the Paris Commune in bloodshed when he ordered

      the execution of 60,000 to 70,000 people in the Crimea. For the

      most part, these executions were carried out with machine-guns.

      At the Municipal Hospital in Alupka, 272 sick and wounded were

      brought out on stretchers in front of the gate of the Institution

      and there shot. The truth of this has been officially confirmed

      in the report made to the Geneva Red Cross. During the 133 days

      of his Terror Rule in Hungary the Jew, Bela Kun, had innumerable

      men murdered. The names of 570 of those have been given in official

      documents. In November 1934, the Chinese Marshal, Tschiangkaischek,

      made public the information that in the province of Kiangsi one

      million people were murdered by the communists and six millions

      robbed of all their possessions. All these blood-stained and

      horror-raising events have reached a climax in the mass murders

      committed throughout Soviet Russia.According to returns given by the Soviets themselves and taking

      reliable sources into account, the number of persons executed

      within the first 5 years of Soviet rule must be placed at about

      1,860,000, in round numbers. Of these, 6,000 were teachers and

      professors, 8,800 were doctors of medicine, 54,000 were army

      officers, 260,000 soldiers, 105,000 police officials, 49,000

      gendarmes, 12,800 civil servants, 355,000 persons of the upper

      classes, 192,000 workers, 815,000 peasants.The Soviet statistician, Oganowsky, estimates the number of

      persons who died of hunger in the years 1921/1922 at 5,200,000.

      The Austrian Cardinal-Archbishop, Monsignor Innitzer, said in

      his appeal of July 1934, that millions of people were dying of

      hunger throughout the Soviet Union. During his speech delivered

      before the House of Lords on the 25th of July, 1934, the Archbishop

      of Canterbury, speaking on reports relative to the famine victims

      in Soviet Russia in 1933, said that the number was nearer to

      six than three millions.We have thus before our eyes a full picture of this fearful

      and harrowing mass terrorisation which is only approximately

      paralleled by even the most blood-curdling examples of war or

      revolution that are recorded in the history of the world. This

      is the actual system of bloodshed and terror and death which

      is carried out by hysterical and criminal political maniacs who

      would have it copied in every country and among every people

      with the same terrorizing practices, in so far as they might

      find the possibility of doing so.In view of all this, it would be idle to bring forward proofs

      of the spirit of discipline and generous consideration which

      the National Socialists showed in carrying through their revolutionary

      aims.Such is “the strange and terrible” resemblance between

      the methods followed by the two regimes which the writer of the

      article in the English newspaper alleges to be similar in “essential

      structure.” But the facts to which I have referred do not

      fill out the picture. Revolutions cost money. Propaganda campaigns

      throughout the world must be financed. Bolshevism procures the

      means of doing so after its own fashion.In the summer of 1907 Stalin led the notorious bomb attack

      at Tiflis on a money transport from the State Bank. Thirty persons

      fell victims to the attack. The 250,000 roubles which were robbed

      from the transport, were sent to Lenin, who was then in Switzerland.

      They were to be at his disposal for revolutionary purposes. On

      the 17th of January 1908 the Jew, Wallack-Meer, who now goes

      by the name of Litwinow and has been Chairman of the Council

      of the League of Nations, was arrested in Paris in connection

      with the bombing and robbing of the transport at Tiflis.The Communist Party in Germany organised and led the plunder

      expeditions there and also the robbery of explosives from official

      depots. The list of such cases brought before the Courts of the

      Reich is very long. In this list are thirty crimes described

      as major and extreme cases. To them must be added the burnings

      and bombings organised and perpetrated without any consideration

      whatsoever for the lives of innocent persons.On the 16th April 1925, there was an explosion in the Cathedral

      of Sophia, which had been organised and carried out by the Bolshevics.

      In July 1927 the Communists set the Palais de Justice at Vienna

      on fire. To celebrate the Lenin Feast, on 22nd January 1930,

      the Simonoff Monastery at Moscow, a building dating from the

      14th century, was blown up. On the night of 27th/28th February

      1933 the Reichstag in Berlin was set on fire as a signal for

      the armed communist rising. Through the medium of strikes, street

      fights and armed risings, the first preparatory stage of the

      Bolshevic revolution is meant to be effected. The methods used

      are the same in all countries. A long series of revolutionary

      acts which might be added on all sides furnish a striking witness

      of this. In one of its propagandist publications, the Komintern

      boasted that it had organised nearly all the strikes which have

      taken place during recent years. These strikes find their violent

      sequel in street fights. From the street fight to the armed rising

      is but one step. In this sequence, the following risings took

      place: October 1917 in Russia, January 1919 the Spartacus rising

      in Germany, 1920 the Max Hoelz revolt in Vogtland, and the Red

      Army in the Ruhr district, 1921 in Central Germany, September

      1923 at Hamburg, December 1924 at Reval, on the 23rd October

      1926, 22nd February 1927 and 21st March 1927 at Shanghai. December

      1927 in Canton, October 1934 in Spain, April 1935 in Cuba and

      May 1935 in the Philippines.Bolshevic propaganda aims its chief blows against the armed forces of 
        a country; because the Bolshevics know that if they were to adopt the 
        principle of trying to secure support from the majority of the people 
        they could never carry out their plans. Force, therefore, is the only 
        means left to them; but in every well-ordered state this meets with the 
        opposition of the army. The Bolshevics accordingly feel bound to introduce 
        their disintegrating propaganda within the ranks of the army itself. Their 
        idea is to corrupt it from within and thus render it ineffective as a 
        bulwark against anarchy.Before the advent of National Socialism to power in Germany

      there was the closest cooperation between the Soviet espionage

      and the Communist organisations here. A foreign department of

      the O.G.P.U. operated offically in our country. It was the special

      representative and directive agent of the Communist espionage.

      The aim of this espionage was not only to obtain military secrets

      in a traitorous way, but also to carry on a system of sabotage

      among the police and the army. Part of the programme was to introduce

      a mutinous spirit into the Reichswehr and by an increasing work

      of revolutionary instruction to bring about a revolt of the soldiers

      and sailors in the German defence forces. From July 1931 to December

      1932 one-hundred-and-eleven cases of high treason were dealt

      with before the German Courts. These cases originated with the

      activities of the Communist Party. Furthermore, there was an

      extraordinary number of cases of espionage of a treasonable character

      in the industrial factories. The most boorish example of the

      interference of “Soviet Diplomats” for the purpose

      of creating domestic political trouble in another country is

      afforded by the Jewish Soviet Ambassador, Joffe, who had to leave

      Berlin on the 6th November 1918, because he had utilized the

      diplomatic courier to transport sabotage material which was to

      be used to undermine the German army and make the revolution

      possible. What were called “Revolution Funds” were

      used in great part by Liebknecht for the purchase of weapons

      for the German Communists, and partly also for the production

      of propaganda material to be used among the army. On the 26th

      December 1918, one of the Socialists members of the Reichstag,

      the Jew, Dr. Oskar Cohn, declared that on the 5th of the previous

      month, he had received 4 million roubles from Joffe for the purpose

      of the German Revolution.We can now see that all these activities were meant for the

      purpose of bringing about the downfall of the German Reich through

      the undermining and corruption of the German Army.Amid all these single acts of terror, of hostage murders and

      mass murders, plunder and arson, strikes and armed risings, espionage

      and sabotage of armies, we see the Communist World Propaganda

      showing its forbidding and grimacing countenance. An idea and

      a movement which has used such dastardly and revolting means

      to secure power and to hold it can maintain itself only by chicanery,

      slander and falsehood. These are the typical methods used by

      Bolshevism in its propaganda; and they are applied in different

      ways according to the suitability of the occasion. Thus, for

      example, we can understand how it is that crises, catastophes

      etc. which happen in other countries outside the Soviet Union

      are exploited by the Bolshevic Propaganda, whereas we are told

      that within the Soviet frontiers a work of social construction

      is in progress that has banished economic distress and created

      a State in which there is no unemployment. The real truth is

      that a condition of commercial disorder exists throughout the

      country and an industrial collapse which baffles description.

      The “Land without Unemployment” contains hundreds of

      thousands and even millions of beggars and homeless children

      who throng the streets of the big cities, and hundreds of thousands

      who are condemned to banishment and forced labour.While in all the other countries alleged Capitalist and Fascist

      dictatorships are in power, Russia affords an example of freedom

      and democratic order. So we are told.In reality this land is wilting under the Jewish-Marxist rule

      of force, which will stop at no means to maintain itself in power.

      The pretended freedom and right of self-determination among the

      nationalities constituting the Soviet Union turns out in fact

      to be a process of enslavement and extirpation of those nationalities

      themselves. The pretended liberation of colonial and semi-colonial

      peoples through the international proletariat is, when looked

      at in its true light, a blood-stained and ruthless example of

      Soviet Imperialism of the worst kind.In Germany itself, before our advent to power, the pronouncements

      of the Communist Party varied unscrupulously according to the

      condition of the times. At first Germany was “a semi-colonial

      sacrifice to the Versailles Powers and was held down through

      the League of Nations.” But when the National Socialist

      movement began to make headway among the German public, the Communist

      Party put forth a programme of “social and national liberation.”

      Then they proclaimed a proletariat confederacy between Berlin

      and Moscow and against Versailles and the League of Nations.

      Today a military pact has been made with Paris and Prague and

      the Soviets have entered the hitherto defamed League of Nations,

      which used to be known as “The Robber League.”The so-called peace policy of the Soviet Union practically

      shows itself in world-revolutionary intrigues among the other

      countries, in unscrupulous stirring-up of conflicts between the

      various states, while at the same time it is arming at a fantastic

      rate in preparation for a war of aggression. People in West-European

      countries talk of a social order without class distinction; but

      in Russia itself, there is a violent differentiation between

      the privileged and dispossessed castes. The Soviet propaganda

      speaks of “a paradise of children that contains the happiest

      youth in the world.”The real state of the case however shows us millions of unsupported

      children, the existence of child labour and even the death penalty

      for children. Bolshevic propaganda deceitfully talks of the “emancipation

      of woman through communism“. The truth is that the institution

      of marriage has been completely set aside, that there is a terrible

      disintegration and abolition of family life, that there is an

      absence of employment for women and a state of prostitution that

      is alarmingly on the increase.Such a regime, in which theory and practice are in glaring contradiction, 
        cannot possibly maintain its position except by the propagation of falsehood 
        and unscrupulous hypocrisy.Before the 30th January, 1933, each time that a workman was

      murdered by order of the Communists the crime was imputed to

      the National Socialists. There were constant false reports of

      mutinies among the Storm Troops and honest German workmen were

      branded as strike-breakers. When Horst Wessel was assassinated

      the public horror became so great that the Communists had to

      bow before it; and, to clear themselves, they put forward the

      story that this dastardly political misdeed arose from an altercation

      between rival claimants to a mistress. When Norkus, who was a

      member of the Hitler Youth, was stabbed by some communist brutes

      the “When National Socialism showed up the work of the Communist Party in 
        Germany the Communist International started the propagandist atrocity 
        stories against National Socialism. The London mock trial was meant to 
        acquit the Communist Party of any guilt of burning the Reichstag by claiming 
        that it had been supported and approved by leading National Socialists. 
        The dead member of the Reichstag could not deny what had been falsely 
        attributed to him. Later on, however, avowals were made by people who 
        had formerly been communist leaders, that not a single word of the truth 
        was contained in the memorandum. The whole thing was avowed by them to 
        have been falsified in all its details for the purpose of bringing National 
        Socialism into discredit before the world. Jurists and journalists of 
        repute, and even an English Lord, descended to the level of making marionettes 
        of themselves at this London mock trial.Since that time the communists have been carrying on a world-wide

      systematic work of propaganda against Germany, because they recognise

      and realise that the National Socialists are their most dangerous

      enemies. Among the eternally recurring themes of this communist

      agitation are the stories of war preparations in the interests

      of German imperialism, preparations for a revanche against France,

      annexations in Denmark and Holland and Switzerland, in the Baltic

      States and the Ukraine etc. and a German crusade against the

      Soviet Union, dissensions in the Party and the Government, especially

      between the Party and the Army, growing discontent among the

      masses, assassinations of leading men in Germany or attempts

      on their lives, preparations for an inflation and the coming

      of a complete economic collapse, the murder and torturing of

      prisoners, religious presecutions and cultural vandelisms of

      all kinds.These propagandist falsehoods are sent out through thousands

      of channels and in thousands of ways, boureois intellectualism-sometimes

      unconsciously, sometimes consciously-is pressed into the service

      of this campaign of defamation. In all European capitals there

      are large offices for the spread of this poison throughout the

      world and large subsidies are furnished by the Komintern to prepare

      and carry out the work. These organisations are constant centres

      of unrest among the nations. They never tire of stirring up trouble

      every way they possibly can.That is Bolshevic propaganda. That is the form in which it

      clothes itself and lives, using falsehood and slander and chicanery,

      so as to make the nations suspicious of one another and hate

      one another, thus spreading a general spirit of unrest; because

      the Bolshevics know so well that they can never bring the communist

      idea to triumph except in an age that is distracted and sceptical.In Germany we have religious controversies which arise from

      profound questions of conscience but have nothing whatsoever

      to do with a denial of religion. These controversies are exploited

      sometimes by harmless and sometimes malicious critics and a parallel

      is drawn between them and the absolutely dogmatic atheism of

      the Bolshevic International. To realise the grotesqueness of

      the parallel it is only necessary to point to a few examples

      in the theory and practice of Communism.In the programme of the Communist International it is openly

      and freely declared that the struggle against every kind of religion

      must be carried on ruthlessly and systematically. Lenin declared

      that “religion is the opium of the people and it is a species

      of fusel oil.” These statements are published in the fourth

      volume of his “Works.”At the second Congress of Atheists, Bucharin declared that

      religion must be “destroyed with the bayonet.” The

      Jew, Gubermann, who, under the name of Jaroslawski, is the leader

      of the Association of Militant Atheists in the Soviet Union,

      has made the following declaration: “It is our duty to destroy

      every religious world-concept... If the destruction of ten million

      human beings, as happened in the last war, should be necessary

      for the triumph of one definite class, then that must be done

      and it will be done.”In its issue of 6th November 1930 Such is the theory and world concept of the juridical principles

      underlying Bolshevic atheism, and such principles are accordingly

      carried out in practice.Up to 1930, 31 bishops, 1,600 clergy and 7,000 monks were

      murdered under the Soviet regime. According to statistics available

      for 1930, there were then confined in prisons, under starvation

      conditions, 48 bishops, 3,700 clergy and 8,000 monks and nuns.

      The “International League against the Third International”

      at Geneva issued statistics on August 6th 1935, showing that

      in Russia 40,000 priests had been arrested, banished or murdered.

      Nearly all the Orthodox churches and chapels have been either

      destroyed or else closed to religious worship and converted into

      clubs, cinemas, barns etc. Prior to our advent to power, the

      atheist propaganda carried out by the Marxists in Germany, whose

      forces we have overthrown, took its stand in favour of the dreadful

      state of things which I have described. The Social Democratic

      “League of Geman Freethinkers” alone had a membership

      of 600,000. The Communist “League of Proletarian Freethinkers”

      had close on 160,000 members. Almost without exception, the intellectual

      leaders of Marxist atheism in Germany were Jews, among them being

      Erich Weinert, Felix Abraham, Dr. Levy-Lenz and others. At regular

      meetings, held in the presence of a notary public, members were

      requested to register their declaration of withdrawal from their

      church for a fee of 2 Marks. And thus the fight for atheism was

      carried on. Between 1918 and 1933 the withdrawals from the German

      Evangelical Churches alone amounted to two-and-a-half million

      persons in Germany. The programme which these atheistic societies

      laid down in regard to sexual matters is amply characterised

      in the following demands publicly expressed at meetings and distributed

      in leaflet form:1. The complete abrogation of those paragraphs of the law

      dealing with the crime of abortion, and the right to have abortion

      procured free of charge in State Hospitals.2. Non-interference with prostitution.3. The abrogation of all bourgeois-capitalistic regulations

      in regard to marriage and divorce.4. Official registration to be optional and the children to

      be educated by the community.5. Abrogation of all penalties for sexual perversities and

      amnesty to be granted to all persons condemned as “sexual

      criminals.”Truly a case of methodical insanity, which has for its aim

      the wilful destruction of the nations and their civilization

      and the substitution of barbarism as a fundamental principle

      of public life.Where are the men behind the scenes of this virulent world

      movement? Who are the inventors of all this madness? Who transplanted

      this ensemble into Russia and is today making the attempt to

      have it prevail in other countries? The answer to these questions

      discloses the actual secret of our anti-Jewish policy and our

      uncompromising fight against Jewry; for the Bolshevic International

      is in reality nothing less than a Jewish International.It was the Jew who discovered Marxism. It is the Jew who for

      decades past has endeavoured to stir up world revolutions through

      the medium of Marxism. It is the Jew who is today at the head

      of Marxism in all the countries of the world. Only in the brain

      of a nomad who is without nation, race and country could this

      satanism have been hatched. And only one possessed of a satanic

      malevolence could launch this revolutionary attack. For Bolshevism

      is nothing less than brutal materialism speculating on the baser

      instincts of mankind. And in its fight against West European

      civilisation it makes use of the lowest human passions in the

      interests of International Jewry.The theory underlying this political and economic fanaticism

      was excogitated by a Jew named Karl Mordechai, alias Marx, the

      son of a Rabbi in Treves. A variant of the same theory sprang

      from the brain of another Jew called Ferdinand Lassalle. He was

      the son of the Jewish Chaim Wolfsohn from Loslau, who changed

      his name first to Losslauer and then to Lasel and finally to

      Lassalle. The Labour Minister of the Paris Commune was the Jew,

      Leo Fraenkel. The Jewish terrorist, Karl Cohen, was the friend

      of Marx. On the 7th May 1866, in Unter den Linden, Berlin, this

      Cohen made two attempts to murder Bismarck by shooting at him.In Pre-war days the editorial staff of the “Vorwaerts”,

      the German Socialist organ, already employed 15 Jews, the majority

      of whom subsequently became leaders of Communism in Germany.

      Among these were Kurt Eisner, Rudolf Hilferding, and Rosa Luxemberg.

      During the Great War the Polish Jews, Leo Joggisches and Rosa

      Luxemberg, were at the head of the driving forces intent on bringing

      about Germany’s military downfall and the subsequent world revolution.

      Another Jew-Hugo Haase-subsequently chairman of the U.S.P.D.

      (Independent German Socialist Party) demanded the refusal of

      war credits on August 4th 1914.On the 10th November 1918, there was formed the “Council

      of Six Representatives of the People” which included the

      Jews Hasse and Landsberg. On the 16th December 1918, was held

      the first meeting of the “General Congress of the Workers’

      and Soldiers’ Soviet of German.”. In this congress the Jews,

      Cohen-Reuss and Hilferding, were the principal speakers. The

      armed forces of Germany were represented by the Jew Hodenberg,

      for the VIII Army, the Jew Levinsohn, for the IV, the Jew Siegfried

      Marck for the Army Dept. A, Nathan Moses for Dept. B. Jacob Riesenfeld

      represented the Army group of Kiew and Otto Rosenberg represented

      the Army group of Kassel.The first Communist Party Congress was held in Berlin on the

      31st December 1918, at which the Jewess Rosa Luxemburg was elected

      leader. The Reich Conference of the Spartacus movement, held

      on the 29th December 1918, was formally opened by the official

      representative of the Soviet Union, a Jew named Karl Radek Sobelsohn,

      whilst Rosa Luxemburg appeared as one of the official speakers.On the night between the 6th and 7th April 1919, after the

      removal of the Jew Eisner in Munich, the Soviet Republic was

      proclaimed there. The leading part in this was taken by the Jews

      Landauer, Toller, Lipp, Erich Muehsam and Wadler. On the 14th

      April 1919, a second Soviet Government was formed in Munich,

      with the Jews Leviné-Nissen, Levien and Tollerat its head. The Press of the German Communist Party in Berlin

      was controlled by the Jews Meyer, Thalheimer, Scholem, Friedlaender

      etc. The lawyers who functioned on behalf of the German Communist

      Party were the Jews Litten, Rosenfeld, Joachim, Apfel, Landsberg

      etc. The well known Bolshevic Jew Raffes, writes: “The hatred

      of Czarism against the Jews was justified; because from the ’sixties

      onwards in all the revolutionary parties the Government had to

      deal with the Jews as the most active members.”At the second Congress of the Social Democratic Labour Party

      of Russia, in 1903, the split occurred which divided the party

      into Bolshevics and Menshevics. In the one as well as in the

      other of these parties the authoritative positions were held

      by Jews. These were as follows:In the Menshevics: Martor (Zederbaum), Trotzki (Bronstein),

      Dan (Gurwitsch), Martynow, Liber (Goldmann), Abramowitsch (Rein),

      Goreff (Goldmann) etc.In the Bolshevics: Borodin (Grusenberg)-subsequently Leader

      of the bolshevic Revolutionary movement in China, at present

      Bolshevic Commissary in Mongolia. Frumkin, Hanecki (Fuerstenberg),

      Jaroslawski (Gubelmann)-Leader of the atheist movement in the

      Soviet Union and throughout the world, Kamenew (Rosenfeld), Laschéwitsch,

      Litwinow (Wallach),-at present Foreign Soviet Commissary and

      formerly Chairman of the League of Nations, Ljadow (Mandelstamm),

      Radek (Sobelsohn), Sinowjew - 1919 to 1926 leader of the Communist

      International, Sokolnikow (Brilliant), Swerdlow-close friend

      and co-worker of Lenin.In the beginning of August 1917, the Sixth Congress of the

      Bolshevic Party was opened. The presiding committee was made

      up of 3 Russians, 6 Jews and 1 Georgian. On the 23rd October

      1917 the historic session of Z.K. (Central Committee) was held.

      Here the armed revolt was decided upon. For the purpose of taking

      over the leadership of the revolt a “Political Bureau”

      and a “War Revolutionary Centre” were established.

      These political and military centres of the Bolshevic Revolution

      were made up of 2 Russians, 6 Jews, 1 Georgian and 1 Pole.In the English “Collection of Reports on Bolshevism in

      Russia”, which was presented to Parliament in April 1919,

      by Command of His Majesty, Report No. 6 contains the following:

      A telegram from Sir M. Findlay to Mr. Balfour (received on 18th

      September 1918):“Following is report by Netherlands Minister at Petrograd,

      6th September, received here today, on the situation in Russia,

      in particular as affecting British subjects and British interests

      under Minister’s protection: . . .“At Moscow I had repeated interviews with Chicherin and

      Karahan. Whole Soviet Government was sunk to the level of a criminal

      organisation. Bolshevics realize that their game is up, and have

      entered upon a career of criminal madness. . .“The danger is now so great that I feel it my duty to

      call the attention of the British and all other Governments to

      the fact that if an end is not put to Bolshevism in Russia at

      once the civilisation of the whole world will be threatened....I

      consider that the immediate suppression of Bolshevism is the

      greatest issue now before the world, not even excluding the War,

      which is still raging and unless, as above stated Bolshevism

      is nipped in the bud immediately, it is bound to spread in one

      form or another over Europe and the whole world as it is organised

      and worked by Jews who have no nationality and whose one object

      is to destroy for their own ends the existing order of things.

      The only manner in which this danger could be averted would be

      a collective action on the part of all Powers.”On the 13th November 1934 the newspaper Of the so most authoritative functionaries from the Party

      and State in the highest councils of the U.S.S.R. we find that

      more than 20 are Jews and only 17 Russians, whereas the percentage

      of Jews to the whole population of the U.S.S.R. is only 1.8.The People’s Commissary for the Interior (formerly Tscheka

      or O.G.P.U.) is the Jew Jagoda. In the Communist International

      (the “General Staff of the World Revolution”)-the Jew

      Pjatnitzki plays the most important role.The leadership of the Bolshevic revolutionary movement in

      all countries lay and still lies in Jewish hands. In some countries,

      such as Poland and Hungary, they are in exclusive control of

      this movement.In the trial against the Jewish communist Schmelz in March

      1935, the Polish Police Commissioner Landèbzrski declared

      as witness that 98% of those arrested in Poland on charges of

      communistic intrigues were Jews.The actual leader in the movement for the Bolshevisation of

      China is the Jew Borodin-Grusenberg.Therewith we may close the account.That is Communism with the mask off. That is its theory, its

      practice and its propaganda. I have given a bald and staid account

      of facts which have been gathered mostly from official sources;

      but this account points to a state of affairs which is so terrible

      and revolting in all its effects that it must shock the average

      civilised human being. This gospel of “the emancipation

      of the proletariat from the yoke of capitalism” is the worst

      and most brutal kind of capitalism that can be imagined. It has

      been thought out, set afoot and led under the inspiration of

      the Mammon worship and materialist thought which is incarnated

      in international Jewry, scattered throughout every country of

      the globe. It is no social experiment. It is nothing else than

      a mammoth system for the expropriation and despoiling of the

      Aryan directive classes in all the nations, and the substitution

      of the Jewish underworld in their place. Those people who put

      themselves forward here as the apostles of a new teaching and

      the liberators of mankind are in reality figures that herald

      anarchy and chaos for the civilised world.There is no longer any political question at issue here. This

      thing cannot be judged or estimated by political rules or principles.

      It is iniquity under a political mask. It is not something to

      be brought before the bar of world history but rather something

      that has to be dealt with by the judicial administration of each

      country. It must be met with the same ruthless and even brutal

      means with which it strives to usurp power or hold power in its

      hands. Here there can be no barganing; because the danger that

      threatens Europe is acute. Overnight it might break in among

      the civilised nations of the world and spread universal catastrophe.

      Those States that make peace with it will soon learn from experience

      that it is not they who will tame Bolshevism but that Bolshevism

      will bring them under its heel. It cannot be said that the Komintern

      has changed its practices. It is and remains what it always was-the

      propagandist and revolutionary machinery which is avowedly intended

      to bring about the downfall of the West.Bolshevism is the declared enemy of all nations and of all

      religions and of all human civilisation. The World Revolution

      is now, as always, its acknowledged and proclaimed goal. Stalin

      himself has said, as the organ of the War Commissariat, “The

      Red Star”, in January 1935, triumphantly announced: “Under

      Lenin’s banner, in the proletarian revolution, we shall triumph

      over the whole world.” And the communist emigrant, Pieck,

      said at the Seventh World Congress of the Komintern, held on

      the 28th July this year: “The triumph of Socialism in Soviet

      Russia proves at the same time that the triumph of Socialism

      throughout the whole world is inevitable.” On the day before

      the Congress was held, “L’Humanité” (the organ

      of the French Communists) greeted it with the outburst: “Long

      live the Komintern, the General Staff of the World Revolution.”Traffic with Bolshevism is not possible either on a political

      basis or on the basis of general principles in life. The acknowledgement

      of the Soviet Union on the part of the United States has given

      rise to an increase in communist propaganda, innumerable strikes

      and general unrest throughout America. The military pact between

      France and the Soviet Union led shortly afterwards to an increase

      of communist votes at the municipal elections, in which they

      won 43 mandates and thus doubled the number of mandates formerly

      held by them, while all the other parties lost accordingly. The

      military alliance between Czecho-Slovakia and the Soviet Union

      led to sabotaging in the army and to an unexpected increase of

      communist votes at the elections which followed.Whoever has made pacts with Bolshevism will have reason to

      rue his act.Nothing could be farther from our minds than the wish to prescribe

      for other nations and their governments or even to counsel them.

      We do not mix up in their domestic affairs. We only see the dangers

      that threaten Europe and we raise our voices in warning, so that

      the magnitude of those dangers may be recognised.As far as we ourselves are concerned, we have completely overcome

      this menace. Indeed perhaps, outside of his work in Germany,

      the greatest service which our Führer has rendered the world

      is that here in Germany he has set up a barrier against world

      Bolshevism against which the waves of this vile Asiatic-Jewish

      flood break in vain. He has taught us not only to recognise Bolshevism

      as the world’s greatest enemy but also to meet it face to face

      and crush it. Instead of this teaching he has supplied a new

      and better and nobler ideal for the liberation of a whole nation.

      In the Sign of this Idea we have fought our battles and brought

      our banners to victory. This ideal has enabled us to free Germany

      from the menace of Bolshevism and banish it once and for all

      from the German nation. Today we know how to cope with these

      insidious forces.The nation has been rendered immune against the poison of

      the red anarchy. It has repudiated the false and hollow catch-words

      of the communistic world propaganda. Seriously and industriously

      and with patience and discipline it has given itself to the solution

      of problems which arise out of its own destiny. History will

      one day give due credit to the Führer for having saved Germany

      from the most acute and deadly peril by overthrowing Bolshevism

      and thereby saving the whole civilisation of the West from the

      abyss that yawned before it.I hope that it will not be left to posterity to recognise

      the greatness of this historic mission, but that it will acknowledged

      by our contemporaries and that they will decide to act upon the

      truth of its teachings. As the true and loyal Old Guard of the

      Führer and the Party, we rejoice that we are standing under

      his banners in this most decisive struggle that the history of

      the world has experienced.The following note is appended to the end of Goebbels’ speech:“In the famine spring that is now coming in, shall similar

      events recur as those The Interdenominational and International Relief Committee

      for the Hunger Such are the authorities to which Dr. Goebbels refers in speaking

      of the famine conditions which exist in Russia under the Bolshevic

      regime.
