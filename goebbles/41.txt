 The English are well known throughout the world for their lack of political 
        scruples. They are experts at the art of hiding their misdeeds behind 
        a facade of virtue. They have been at it for centuries, and it has become 
        such a part of their nature that they hardly notice it any longer. They 
        carry on with such a pious expression and deadly seriousness that they 
        even convince themselves that they are the exemplars of political virtue. 
        They do not admit their hypocrisy to themselves. It never happens that 
        one Englishman says to another with a wink or a smile “We don’t want 
        to fool ourselves, do we now.” They do not only behave as if they 
        were the model of piety and virtue  they really believe that they 
        are. That is both amusing and dangerous.One has to be on the alert when dealing with them. They managed to conquer 
        the world because they never encountered a worthy opponent. In the last 
        three centuries we Germans often had comparable strength in Europe, but 
        we were usually far inferior when it came to exploiting national and international 
        opportunities. The English were unshakably confident in their belief that 
        Great Britain’s world domination was a sign of divine providence. Those 
        who attempted to resist, or defend themselves against the empire were 
        ruthlessly suppressed, using the occasional low blow when it was necessary. 
        The English always talked about their nobility and sense of fair play, 
        but they were anything but when circumstances required. We saw enough 
        proof of that at the end of the war, and in the years from 1919 to 1933.We Germans, on the other hand, have been a political people

      only in the past few years. England recognizes this change as

      a major political danger in Europe. It was entirely different

      before the war. England then could do to Germany what it wanted.

      We were a harmless people who went about our business, giving

      the world our poets, musicians, and philosophers, never realizing

      that there were other nations just waiting for the opportunity

      to knock us flat.England was at the center of it all. It found the occasion,

      the method, and the results. The war caught Germany entirely

      by surprise, proof that we had not wanted it. Then England got

      moving. English propaganda turned the whole world against us.

      One had not thought them capable of it. The experts found its

      planning and execution brilliant. English propaganda was limited

      to a few powerful slogans. With devilish depravity, they were

      spread systematically throughout the entire world and pounded

      into the brains of millions of people. At the end, they were

      helpless victims of mass hypnosis.There were really only a few slogans that the English spread

      throughout the world. They spoke of children’s hands chopped

      off, eyes poked out, women raped, and old people tortured.Long years of anti-German propaganda campaign persuaded the whole world 
        that Germany was a nation of barbarians, uncivilized and inhumane, and 
        that it was the moral and cultural obligation of the rest of the earth 
        to destroy Germany and to break its power. Only then could the world know 
        peace and friendship. That made it easy for the rest of the world to join 
        England in fighting Germany.We Germans had no idea how to respond. We watched the English

      campaign with honest stupidity. The good German citizen shook

      his head and wondered how anyone could lie like that. We suffered

      the consequences at the end of the war. During the last months

      of the war, England attempted to hammer into the minds of the

      German population the idea that it was fighting our government,

      not us. The English did not want to hurt the German people, their

      war propaganda said. The Kaiser had to go. Then the European

      nations could end the war.American President Wilson proclaimed his well-known Fourteen

      Points. In brief, they announced that the Allies did not want

      to force peace on the Germans, that none of the warring countries

      should have to pay reparations, or be otherwise harmed, or lose

      national honor or territory. The Allies’ only demand was to replace

      the Kaiser with a republic, after which peace with honor would

      follow for everyone.These stupid lies were brewed by the English. Wilson was simply

      the Foreign Office’s loudspeaker. And good old Germany believed

      what England got the Americans to say. We fell into the trap.

      We did everything that England wanted, and had to pay the bill

      in the end.When the news of the German revolution reached London in November

      1918, they could hardly believe it. Even the highest circles

      doubted it. One of England’s leading men of the time later said

      privately that London had not thought it possible that the German

      people would fall for the swindle.The results were catastrophic. Germany was robbed of its honor

      and its land. We were disarmed and robbed of our merchant fleet

      and navy, and of our colonies. We were given an impossible reparations

      burden. Its only purpose was to wreck the German economy.Still, it did have one good result. It taught the German people

      something. On the one hand Germany was impoverished, but the

      way was paved for the National Socialist renaissance. Its battle

      was directed against the Treaty of Versailles, as well as those

      who benefited from it both at home and abroad. It disposed of

      those who had signed the Treaty of Versailles and presented those

      who supported them with the choice either of setting the shameful

      treaty aside or of being confronted with accomplished facts on

      the part of a Germany once more strong.Germany today has been transformed and educated by National Socialism. 
        It joins the great powers, a nation entirely different than that of 1914, 
        and especially 1918. The German people has become political. If it were 
        today as it formerly was, it would be in danger of falling prey to another 
        English swindle, just like that of the war. England is trying to do exactly 
        the same today as it did with such success during the war. England’s swindle 
        today is just as blatant, dirty, and impudent as it was back then. They 
        think we are as dumb today as we were then. The men in London think the 
        German people today are as dumb as they rightly thought we were in 1914 
        and 1918. This is their mistake.Today the English newspapers openly write that the task of English propaganda 
        is to drive a wedge between the German people and its leadership. But 
        we hear that as clearly as they do, and the German people draws the proper 
        conclusion. That is the goal of English propaganda! They want to split 
        Hitler and the nation. Naturally they find hypocritical and smooth-sounding 
        arguments, just as they did during the Kaiser’s day. They say that Germany 
        must return to the camp of the civilized nations. Oh? To the circle of 
        civilized nations that we have come to know during the past 25 years? 
        Those civilized nations that even after the end of the war allowed millions 
        of mothers and children to starve, that sent Negroes to bring culture 
        to the Rhine, that shot Schlageter, stole our colonies, exploited Germany, 
        and coldly and cynically broke their most solemn promises to us, the promises 
        the German people had been deceived by?It was easy to fool Germany back then. Today, we Germans respond

      differently. And we now have ways to defend ourselves against

      London’s lies once the English propaganda machine moves into

      high gear. It floods the public with scare after scare, spreading

      countless lies with the most pious expression. They report rebellions

      by German soldiers, insurrections and strikes in working class

      districts, growing conflicts between classes, anarchy in the

      Protectorate. They sympathize with a small circle of opposition

      clergy and make that cause of a few complaining intellectuals

      into the cause of England and the entire civilized world.It does not work any longer. Our people have been educated in the school 
        of National Socialism. We no longer naively accept England’s shamelessness. 
        We are defending ourselves, even counterattacking as is the National Socialist 
        custom. And how! Our counterattack is powerful, and hits dead center. 
        When they throw mud at us, we do not stand back 30 meters and wave our 
        little sword. We have developed thick skins. We are not refined aesthetes 
        who get queasy in the midst of political disputes. That annoys the enemy.The experienced English propagandists for the first time are seeing an 
        opponent facing them whom they did not previously think they had to worry 
        about. They are being surpassed in an area in which they once were the 
        undisputed master. The National Socialist movement has taught the German 
        nation not only to defend against propaganda, but to use it itself. We 
        Germans know something about propaganda. During our struggle for power 
        our enemies had absolute power, yet we threw them to the ground. We are 
        not as defenseless today as we once were. Today we have the most powerful 
        army in the world. We defend an idea that fills us with holy conviction, 
        and we wield a propaganda that hits its target, that is experienced and 
        hardened by battle. We use this spiritual weapon with pleasure and enthusiasm.The new version of the charge of chopped of children’s hands

      will not work with the German people any more, nor will it persuade

      most of the rest of the world. People see through John Bull.

      The world’s people know what is going on. England can look for

      allies wherever it wants, but it will not find them in Germany.

      There it will find nothing but thundering laughter. Our advice

      to the propaganda experts in the Foreign Office is to get rid

      of their old lies and find better ones that will be worth our

      while to deal with.If the English want a fight with Germany, they will not be

      fighting the Führer or a small ruling circle, but a united

      nation of 80 million Germans. They might want to find a way other

      than armed conflict. That would have no prospect of success,

      and would in fact present England with the real danger of losing

      its Empire. One does London a favor by encouraging it to be realistic,

      to have a clear understanding of Germany, and to stop the bombast

      and empty threats. It must face the hard and unchangeable facts.
