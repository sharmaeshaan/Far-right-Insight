 German news policy has not had an easy time of it in the past weeks. 
        Vast military operations were being planned about which the enemy had 
        no idea, and of which, of course, he could be given no inkling, so the OKW report In the interests of the war, German news policy was forced

      into silence, which naturally led to a certain nervousness on

      the part of the German people. English and Bolshevist propaganda

      thought that their hour had come. They could speak, we could

      not. All the nonsense from London and Moscow over the past weeks

      would take a long time to discuss. It is also unnecessary to

      repeat any of it. It is already trash, tossed aside by the fiery

      storm of earth-shaking military operations whose long-term effects

      we still cannot entirely foresee. Silence was worth it.In all their chattering and boasting, the Bolshevists and

      the English entirely forgot to pay attention. They thought our

      reluctance to answer their simple and ridiculous lies was the

      result of weakness, so one day Budjenny and his five armies found

      themselves in our trap. We won a battle that will go down in

      history as a classic battle of annihilation. Now all the uproar

      is on the other side.We have often seen similar things during the war. They always

      follow the same plan, and one would assume that our opponents

      have learned something. There is no evidence that they have.

      They run into the mousetrap as soon as they smell the cheese,

      with the result that their premature shouts of victory lead to

      a moral defeat as well. If only they could shut up and wait!

      But no, they take their illusionary successes seriously and keep

      talking big. If we had made even a small percentage of the mistakes

      they have made, not even a dog would take a piece of food from

      us. It began with Poland and continues in the Soviet Union. They

      have always made false predictions. They still have the gall

      to present themselves to the world as pure and incorruptible

      fanatics for truth who present things as they are, while we, they

      claim, abolish freedom of the press, send lie after lie into the

      world, and lie so much that even we do not know the truth any

      longer.It is true that we have made some mistakes during the war. We do not 
        hesitate to admit it. By and large, however, we have told the truth. In 
        contrast to England, we have correctly estimated the military, economic, 
        and psychological strengths of the warring powers. We do not need to be 
        embarrassed when one reminds us of our speeches and articles from 1939 
        or 1940. Can Mr. Churchill say the same? He missed the bus just before 
        the Norwegian campaign. Then there was the unbreakable Maginot Line, the 
        Ruppel Pass that could be held forever, the island of Crete that England 
        would defend as dearly as its own life, or the Stalin Line, which was 
        to be defended to the last man, but then suddenly never even existed. 
        All swindles and lies!One ought to be able to assume that English news policy has

      lost all credibility with neutral nations. To the contrary! Swedish

      and Swiss newspapers cite its lies every day with general satisfaction,

      printing our facts only when they can no longer be denied. There

      are even some unteachable people among us who cannot resist turning

      secretly and quietly, behind closed doors, to Radio London in

      order to enrich their political and military knowledge with English

      swindles. Two recent death sentences and a series of prison terms

      prove that. What are they doing wrong? Their behavior is not

      only criminal, it is tremendously stupid. They can hardly seriously

      maintain that the plutocrats in London are producing expensive

      German-language programming to keep Herr Bramsig and Frau Knöterich

      informed about the political and military situation. They openly

      admit that they are doing it to throw our people into uncertainty

      and sow dissension between the leadership and the nation. Their

      news is directed entirely toward this goal, and serves only this

      purpose. Herr Bramsig and Frau Knöterich volunteer, with

      no compulsion, to hear such nonsense. Do they gain anything?

      Hardly! First, they run the risk of ending up in jail as traitors,

      and secondly, even if that does not happen, they wind up with

      new worries and sleepless nights, since they have no way to separate

      right from wrong and truth from falsehood.The English, for example, estimated our casualties at three million during 
        the weeks we were silent. That naturally was utter nonsense. First, the 
        English are in no position to estimate our losses, and second they do 
        not care to, since they want to cause unrest in the German population 
        through their enormously exaggerated figures. We cannot reply to their 
        lies, since we want to provide only accurate figures, which simply are 
        not available at the moment. We therefore have to restrict ourselves to 
        saying that our losses are at the expected levels, which we can say in 
        good conscience given the facts available to us. The prison-deserving 
        listeners to Radio London run around for three or four weeks with a casualty 
        total of three million, whispering it to others, only to learn one day 
        that although our losses are certainly painful to those directly involved, 
        they are not even 10% of the English figures.Aside from the criminal nature of such behavior, does it really pay to 
        listen to the English? We have to listen to them for professional reasons. 
        Cross our hearts, we would be delighted if we were free from this unpleasant 
        duty. It is so boring and stupid that it gradually revolts us. Remember, 
        too, that we know how things really stand, and thus can separate truth 
        from swindle, something Herr Bramsig and Frau Knöterich cannot do. 
        No one gives them speeches about the real state of things. If our radio 
        and press are silent, it usually means operations of truly gigantic scope 
        are being prepared. It is the duty of each German to wait with confidence 
         a confidence, by the way, that is justified by countless historic 
        successes. When Herr Bramsig and Frau Knöterich secretly listen to 
        Radio London, they are being played for fools by our most bitter enemies.That is not only criminal, it is absolutely unfair. The Führer

      and his military and political staff are working day and night,

      and not for themselves, but for the people that means everything

      to them. Just before the great successes, they often hold their

      breaths, wondering if everything will work, if things will really

      turn out as planned, if perhaps somewhere unforeseen problems

      will surface. Then they are delighted to once again announce

      a great victory to the people, compensating it for the long

      period of silence. Our soldiers march day and night through dust

      and rain, destroying bunkers and fortifications, wading through

      streams and swimming across raging rivers, having only one thought:

      to close the pocket at the right time and to seal the enemy within

      an unbreakable wall.Meanwhile, Herr Bramsig and Frau Knöterich sit at the radio listening 
        to Mr. Churchill. That is thankless, contemptible, and vile. It lacks 
        even the most basic respect for the work and responsibility of the leadership. 
        I know that when Radio London hears this, they will jump to the defense 
        of Herr Bramsig and Frau Knöterich. They deserve nothing less. The 
        London Jews and plutocrats would like nothing better than such a conversation. 
        They are too dumb and foolish to be worth the trouble. And besides that, 
        we lack both the time and the inclination. We have better things to do. 
        We have no obligation to do them a favor. Our goal is to serve the German 
        people, to help them to win this war, since we know that it is our last, 
        but also our greatest chance. We know well enough the terrible consequences 
        British propaganda had for us in the World War. We do not want to risk  that danger a second time. If we had had someone then able 
        to stand up to London’s lies, this war probably would not have been necessary. 
        This time, we have learned our lesson thoroughly and forever more.Take the following example. The German army does not attack

      Kiev for weeks, both to save German lives and because the leadership

      knows that the city will fall into our hands as the result of

      the great battle of encirclement that finished last Sunday. One

      naturally can say nothing about such a plan, since the enemy

      will hear of it and take precautions. While we are making feverish

      preparations, Britain’s propaganda can spread all the lies it

      wants without any fear of us contradicting them. They claim our

      attack has stopped because the plague has broken out in Kiev.

      Herr Bramsig and Frau Knöterich hear that over English radio

      and pass the rumor on. A woman or mother whose husband or son

      is near Kiev worries unnecessarily, and we cannot tell the truth,

      since we must conceal it in the interests of our soldiers.Does not such rumor mongering deserve not only prison, but

      also the contempt of the entire people? We cannot excuse it on

      grounds of stupidity. We are fighting for our lives. Let us be

      not only as strong as lions, but as clever as serpents. We must

      defeat the enemy both through strength and intelligence. If Frau

      Bramsig and Frau Knöterich do not have enough brains in

      their heads to see that during a war one may not listen to the

      enemy, then they must receive exemplary punishment.That, too, is a requirement of victory.
