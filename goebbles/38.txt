 We feel it necessary to take up a current issue. The problem

      is the shortage of coffee that recently surfaced in several parts

      of the Reich, and has not yet been entirely overcome.It is actually rather depressing that one must speak of this

      matter in public. However, there is a certain category of our

      contemporaries who take pleasure in exploiting every German shortage

      to amuse themselves or discredit the National Socialist regime.Coffee is hardly a necessity of life, or an indispensable pleasure. It 
        is certainly a pleasant thing. Conversation flows over a pot of coffee, 
        yes? Limiting coffee consumption, or even giving it up entirely for a 
        while, however, hardly damages one’s health. The opposite, in fact. It 
        is true that, as Mussolini said in his speech at the May Field, National 
        Socialism and Fascism share a dislike of a comfortable and pleasant life.If coffee is in short supply for a while, it is hardly a necessity

      of life. It would be something different if potatoes or bread

      were lacking, things that are necessary for daily life. Coffee

      is a pure luxury item that one enjoys when one has it, but can

      easily give up when necessity or economic pressures require.If coffee is in short supply, every German must know that

      it is not because of the government’s ill will that is unwilling

      to let the people enjoy a cup of coffee, but rather because of a

      national need, an economic requirement given Germany’s situation,

      one that people have to accept.The duty of every loyal person in such a situation is to reduce

      or entirely give up the luxury item in question, and to resume

      it only when sufficient supplies are again at hand, when the

      problem is overcome.The reasons for the coffee shortage, which is still not entirely

      overcome, are clear enough. They have to do with foreign currency

      reserves and exports. The situation became evident early in January.

      One must remember that coffee consumption in Germany has increased

      about 50% since 1933. 2,160,000 sacks of coffee were imported

      in 1933, 3,290,000 in 1938. Coffee consumption in Germany has

      not decreased, but rather increased greatly since the Führer

      took power; the difference is that more people are drinking coffee.That is a socialist development. In 1932 only the prosperous

      drank coffee. The unemployed had no money to buy coffee, so there

      was no shortage. But now the seven million who were unemployed

      in 1932 are working. They are now and again able to enjoy life’s

      pleasures. That inevitably leads to occasional shortages in certain

      areas of our food and luxury goods supplies.It should really please every German that increasing numbers

      of our people can enjoy life’s pleasures, even if the result

      is an occasional personal inconvenience.The fact that we have to limit our coffee consumption somewhat

      and cannot import more coffee is the result of shortages of foreign

      currency, which everyone knows we need for things more important

      than coffee. It is not a matter of “guns instead of coffee,”

      but given the current world situation it seems to us more important

      to build up our military forces than to supply our coffee drinkers

      with all the coffee they desire. We hardly need to say that we

      have no desire or ability to pay for the coffee we import in

      cash. We must pay for our imports with German goods that we export.Coffee in Germany is only a pleasant beverage. It is not a

      daily drink for the broad working masses, for whom it is too

      expensive. Still, the economic barometer shows that there has

      been a dramatic increase in coffee consumption since the pre-war

      period. But for a few weeks one saw lines of coffee lovers outside

      the shops in big cities. A certain sort of person who never drank

      coffee before suddenly felt it necessary to announce his taste

      for it. That was not only disgraceful, it was a scandal.A few weeks ago a prominent foreigner who is sympathetic to

      National Socialism noted the lines outside the shops in the streets

      of Berlin. He thought they must be in line for potatoes or bread.

      When he discovered that these people were waiting in line for

      coffee, he could only shake his head.There is no doubt that some people have taken pleasure in hoarding coffee. 
        They did this in part to ensure their own supply  as if coffee were 
        a necessity of life  but also in part to make difficulties for the 
        National Socialist government. For example, a woman from Berlin’s better 
        circles in the Wilmersdorf district was caught with eight quarter pounds 
        of coffee that she had bought from various shops. She explained she wanted 
        to be sure she had enough. Well, that’s one way of looking at it.Such people are naturally only a ridiculous minority, but

      they are in the position to damage our people’s good name. And

      it is always the same people. They give reluctantly to the Winter

      Relief drive, they abuse the National Socialist government and

      the National Socialist movement, oppose everything that we do,

      lose heart in every crisis, find the party block warden in their

      building an annoyance, are convinced adherents to confessional

      movements, love political jokesters, and get their news from

      foreign radio stations or newspapers.Naturally they do not think it beneath their dignity to enjoy the benefits 
        of the National Socialist state. Their thanks is to cheerfully vote no 
        in the referendum to approve Austria’s joining the Reich. They have no 
        idea what national discipline means. Their political behavior is disgraceful. 
        Everything that comes from abroad is chic, everything that we do is shocking.It is of course self-evident for party members not only to reduce, but 
        to eliminate their consumption of foodstuffs or luxury items that are 
        in short supply in Germany. Old party members have learned in the long 
        years of struggle to pay heed to the health of the people. These old party 
        members, however, become outraged when they see that the beneficiaries 
        of their consideration are these thoughtless and inconsiderate people 
        who had as little to do with National Socialism’s rise to power as they 
        do in its current endeavors.These people do not have the intelligence to see that Germany

      today is fighting for its economic existence that will decide

      its very future. If the battle brings even a few annoyances,

      these people see enough reason to criticize the National Socialist

      state, forget its previous successes and cry about their missing

      cup of coffee. A few weeks ago, the hostile foreign press ran

      pictures of lines of these coffee drinkers and their friends

      outside of the shops. The hostile press naturally did not say

      that they were waiting for coffee, but rather claimed they were waiting

      for potatoes or bread and spread to the world fables that famine

      had broken out in Germany.We do not consider these stupid and thoughtless people worth

      taking seriously, except when their behavior harms Germany’s

      prestige in the world. That is what happened here.These people, by the way, have no reason to complain about

      the economic difficulties that Germany is facing. They made no

      protest in 1919 when the Treaty of Versailles forced us to give

      up our colonies. We were the ones who protested. They did not

      oppose in any way the Dawes Plan or the Young Treaty, which devoured

      our last economic reserves. In fact, they branded us traitors

      when we opposed them.Their cowardly acquiescence explains why Germany has no colonies, and 
        therefore cannot cover our needs from our own resources. There is no question 
        that if the return of Germany’s colonies suddenly became a hot issue, 
        these people would grouse, complain, criticize, and predict a new world 
        war. I do have to tell these intellectual souls that we have no intention 
        whatsoever of taking heed of their tender sensibilities by changing our 
        economic policies, which serve the interests and needs of the entire German 
        people, and particularly the working people.These dear people simply will have to learn patience and adjust

      to things as they are. At the worst, they will less frequently

      enjoy complaining about the party and the state over a cup of

      coffee, saying things like: “Did you hear, Frau Meyer, that

      our new block warden is our doorman? What does one say? My husband

      says that is Bolshevism. But don’t pass it on. We don’t want

      any unpleasantness!”We old National Socialists pay no attention to people who

      talk and bitch like that. We cannot ignore the fact, however,

      that these coffee drinkers are using a ridiculous shortage of

      coffee that decent people do not worry about in the least to

      stand in line outside the shops as if famine had broken out in

      Germany. That is distressing and dreadful, and we do not want

      to see such pictures in the future.We have seen to it that these coffee lines have vanished from German 
        cities. Decent people, when coffee is in short supply  as it is 
        today  either reduce their consumption or stop drinking it entirely. 
        The coffee drinkers can wait until there is once again enough coffee. 
        Then they can return to their coffee parties and say things like “Well, 
        Frau Meyer, what do you think about that? Things are pretty bad, they 
        are pretty bad!”
