 
There are two fundamentally different kinds of speakers: those
  who use reasoning, and those who speak from the heart. They reach
  two different sorts of people, those who understand through reason,
  and those who understand through the heart. Speakers who aim
  for the reason are generally found in parliaments, those who
  speak from the heart speak to the people.The speaker who uses reason, if he is to be effective, must
      command a wide range of statistical and factual material. He
      must be a master of dialectic as the pianist is master of the
      keyboard. With ice cold logic, he develops his line of thinking
      and draws irrefutable conclusions. He is most effective with
      people who work primarily or exclusively with reason. Big and
      compelling successes are denied him. He does not understand how
      to fire up the masses for a great cause. He is limited to educational
      discourse. Since he is cold, he leaves his listeners cold. At
      best he persuades people, but never mobilizes them and sets them
      marching regardless of their own ideas or the element of personal
      risk involved.These rhetorical geniuses are the drummers of fate. They begin
      their work alone in dark and dismal historical epochs and suddenly
      and unexpectedly find themselves in the spotlight of new developments.
      They are the speakers that make history.As any great man, a gifted speaker has his individual style. He can only 
        speak as he is. His words are written into his body. He speaks his own 
        language, whether in posters or letters, essays, addresses or speeches.There are many examples in history that prove that great speakers
      resemble each other only in their effects. The nature of their
      appeals to people, their appeals to the heart, vary with the
      time, the nation, and the character of the epoch. Caesar spoke
      differently to his legions than Frederick the Great did to his
      army, Napoleon differently to his guard than Bismarck did to the
      members of the Prussian Parliament. Each used language that his
      hearers understood and used words and thoughts that reached their
      emotions and found an echo in their hearts.The daemon of their
      era gave each the ability to speak in a way that raised them
      above his century as one of the eternal proclaimers of great
      ideas, one of those who makes history and transforms nations.The various races seem to have differing abilities in this
      realm. Some seem too reserved to practice the art, others seem
      practically predestined to it. One speaks of Latin eloquence,
      for example. The wealth of average and important speakers in
      the Roman peoples is also some proof of this. It also seems true
      that rhetorical ability in these nations finds a public that
      understands it and gives it the widest possibility of success.In the past, our German people was not particularly gifted in this regard. 
        We had more than enough statesmen and soldiers, philosophers and scientists, 
        musicians and poets, builders and engineers, geniuses of planning and 
        organization. But we always lacked those with rhetorical gifts. No one 
        after Fichte�s classic speeches to the German people was able to reach 
        the people�s hearts, until Bismarck. When Bismarck departed, no one followed 
        until the collapse after the World War brought forth a new preacher. In 
        between we had at best serviceable speakers, suitable for everyday or 
        parliamentary use or service on boards of directors, but who encountered 
        only icy reserve when they spoke to the people.This was probably the result of the times. There were no great
      ideas, no powerful projects. Rhetoric sank into a morass of self-satisfaction.
      The only apparent exception, Marxism, was secretly allied with
      them and its speakers represented a materialism that could never
      release the spark of true genius.But revolutions bring forth true speakers, and true speakers
      make revolutions! One should not overestimate the role of written
      or printed words in revolutions, but the secret magic of the
      spoken word reaches directly the emotions and the hearts of people.
      It reaches the eye and the ear, and the electrifying force of
      the masses seized by the human voice sweeps with it the wavering
      and the doubting.What would happen to a statesmanly genius who fate had for
      some reason placed in an inferior position if he lacked the power
      of speech and the explosive force of the word! It gives him the
      ability to make ideas from ideals and realities from ideas. With
      its help, he gathers people to his flag who are ready to fight
      with him; driven by it, men risk their health and their lives
      to bring a new world to victory. An organization comes from the
      propaganda of the word, a movement from the organization, and
      that movement conquers the state. The important thing is not
      whether an idea is right; the decisive thing is whether one can
      present it effectively to the masses so that they become its
      adherents. Theories remain theories when living men to not give
      them expression. Living people in difficult times follow only
      an appeal that reaches their hearts because it comes from the
      heart.It is difficult to place the Führer within these categories.
      His ability to reach the masses is unique and remarkable, fitting
      no organizational scheme or dogma. It would be ridiculous to
      think he attended some sort of speaker school; he is a rhetorical
      genius who developed his own abilities with no help from anyone
      else. One cannot imagine that the Führer ever spoke differently
      than he does today, or that he will ever speak differently. He
      speaks his heart, and therefore reaches the hearts of those who
      hear him. He has the amazing gift of sensing what is in the air.
      He has the ability to express things so clearly, logically and
      directly that listeners are convinced that that is what they
      have always thought themselves. That is the true secret of the
      effectiveness of Adolf Hitler�s speeches. The Führer is
      neither a speaker from reason nor from the heart. He uses both,
      depending on the needs of the moment. The essential characteristics
      of his speeches to the people are: clear organization, irrefutable
      logical reasoning, simplicity and clarity of expression, razor-sharp
      dialectic, a developed and sure instinct for the masses and
      their feelings, an electrifying emotional appeal that is used
      sparingly, and the ability to reach out to the souls of the people
      in a way that never goes unanswered.Long ago when he was still far from power, the Führer
      spoke to a meeting filled primarily with his political opponents.
      From the beginning, he was rejected. For two hours he struggled
      with the stubbornness of his audience, addressing all their problems
      and objections until at the end there was only thundering agreement,
      jubilation and enthusiasm. As he concluded, someone yelled from
      the highest row: “Hitler is Columbus!”That got to the heart of it. He had stood the egg on its end.
      He clarified the confused and mysterious nature of the age. He
      showed his hearers in a clear and simply way that the man in
      the street had long sensed, but had not found the courage to
      express. Hitler said what everyone thought and felt! More than
      that, he had the civil courage in the face of nearly everyone
      else to express with iron logic what had to be done.The Führer is the first person in Germany to use speech
      to make history. As he began, it was all he had. He had only
      a strong heart and his pure word. Using them, he reached the
      deepest depths of the souls of his people. He did not speak like
      everyone else. He could not be compared with them. He understood
      the cares and worries of the little man and spoke about them,
      but they were for him only brush strokes on the dreadful painting
      of Germany�s collapse. He did more than simply talk about them,
      he was not a mere reporter like the others. He took the events
      of the day and gave them a larger national significance that
      put them in context. He appealed to the good, not the bad instincts
      of the masses. His speaking was a magnet that drew to him whomever
      in the people who still had iron in his blood.Stupid and empty-headed bourgeois people for a time were pleased
      to disparage him as a “drummer.” They made themselves
      ridiculous, but did not realize it. Since they entirely lacked
      rhetorical ability, they thought his was a lesser form of leadership.
      They strove for power without realizing that Marxism had taken
      power from them by force, and would give up that power only as
      the result of force. They formed groups when they needed a national
      movement. They attempted putsches when revolution was in the
      air. They held the masses in contempt because they did not want
      to lead them. The masses bow only to him who puts them under
      his uncompromising command. They obey only him who knows how
      to give orders. They have a fine instinct for determining if
      something is really meant, or only said.It is perhaps a classic proof of the inner strength of the
      German people that it heard the appeal of a man who went his
      own way, in opposition to the state and society, the press and
      public opinion, apparently against all reason and good sense.
      It is also a classic proof for the outstanding rhetorical brilliance
      of the Führer that his word alone was enough to transform
      an entire period, to defeat an apparently strong state and to
      bring in a new era.An historic figure who has such impact must command all the skills of 
        the spoken word. That is the case with the Führer. He speaks as confidently 
        before workers as before scientists. His words strike deep into the hearts 
        of farmers and city-dwellers. When he speaks to children, they are deeply 
        moved. The magic of his voice reaches men�s secret feelings. He translates 
        historical philosophy into the language of the people. He has the ability 
        to call up long forgotten history and make those who hear him feel as 
        if they had always known about it. There is no element of superiority 
        in his speaking, the kind of thing one sees in the speeches of the educated.His words always focus on the central ideas of our people,
      our nation, and our race. He can express things in a thousand
      different ways. The listener never feels that he has heard it
      before. The masses hear the same major ideas of our national
      renaissance in ever new forms. There is nothing doctrinaire in
      his style. If he makes an assertion, it is proven by a multitude
      of examples. The examples are not taken only from the experiences
      of a particular area or class, thus leaving everyone else untouched.
      They come from everywhere in the nation, such that each is spoken
      to. They are chosen with such care that even the blindest opponent
      must in the end grant that, unlike the parliamentary speakers,
      this man believes what he says.Ordinary life is presented in a way that grips the hearers.
      The problems of the day are not explained only with the difficult
      tools of a worldview, but with wit and bitting irony. His humor
      triumphs; one cries with one eye and laughs with the other. Every
      tone of daily life is touched upon.A sure sign of a good speech is that it not only sounds good,
      but reads well. The Führer�s speeches are stylistic masterpieces,
      whether he  improvizes at the podium, speaks from brief notes,
      or  speaks from
      a manuscript at an important international occasion. If one is not in his immediate vicinity, he cannot
      tell if the speech is a written speech delivered extemporaneously,
      or an extemporaneous speech delivered as if it were written out.
      His speeches are always ready to be printed. The picture would
      not be complete if we did not point out that the Führer
      is a master of rhetorical discussion. The last time the public
      had an opportunity to see him in action was his reckoning with
      the Social Democrats in the Reichstag in 1933, when he responded
      to the then Representative Wels. One had the feeling that a cat
      was playing with a mouse. Marxism was driven from one corner
      into another. Wherever he sought cover, he faced destruction.
      With breathtaking precision, one rhetorical blow after another
      fell on him. Without a manuscript or notes, the Führer gave
      a major, long-desired attack on Social Democratic parliamentarians
      who here received their Judges and states attorney had learned to respect his rhetorical offensives. 
        They asked the accused or the witness Hitler naive sounding questions 
        or tried to lead him onto thin ice with innocent sounding questions. The 
        1924 trial on the uprising of 8-9 November 1923 turned into a triumphant 
        success for the accused, since the Führer overcame the mountains 
        of files, hostility, and misunderstanding through the shining strength 
        of his obvious truthfulness and the power of his gripping eloquence. The 
        Republic probably regretted that Leipzig Reichswehr trial in 1930, in 
        which it tried to destroy the Führer and his movement. They gave 
        him a platform from which the whole people heard his rhetorical effectiveness. 
        One recalls today with a shudder that a Jewish-Communist attorney fired 
        questions at him for nine hours straight, but recalls with satisfaction 
        that Jewish Bolshevism found an opponent whose words and ideas wrestled 
        it to the ground.We saw and experienced the Führer as a speaker at the Party Rally 
        of Freedom in 1935. He spoke fifteen times within a period of seven days. 
        Not once did he repeat a thought or a phrase. Everything was new, fresh, 
        young, vital, and compelling. He spoke in one way to officials, another 
        to the S.A. and S.S. men, one way to the youth and another to the women. 
        In his major speech on culture, he explained the deepest secrets of the 
        arts, and his speech to the Wehrmacht was understood by the last soldier 
        in the last battalion. The entire life of the German people was spanned 
        by his speeches. He is a proclaimer of the word who can express its thousand-fold 
        nature through the grace of God.The Führer it at his best, however, before a small audience.
      Here he is able to reach each individual member of the audience.
      His speaking carries away the listener, who never loses interest
      because he always feels spoken to directly. He may speak about
      a random theme with an expertise that astonishes the specialists,
      or in speaking about everyday matters suddenly raise them to
      universal significance.On such occasions the Führer can be more intimate and
      precise than a public speech permits. He can go into the heart
      of things with irrefutable logic. Only one who has heard him
      in such a setting can understand his full brilliance as a speaker.One can say that his speeches to his people and the world have an audience 
        unprecedented in world history. They are words that inspire the heart 
        and have a lasting impact in forming a new international epoch, There 
        is probably no educated person in the world who has not heard the sound 
        of his voice and who, whether he understood the words or not, felt that 
        his heart was spoken to by magical words. Our people is fortunate to know 
        the voice the world hears, a voice that puts words into thoughts and uses 
        those thoughts to move an era. This man is a man with the courage to say 
        yes and no, without qualifying them with an if or a but. Millions of people 
        are suffering from bitter sorrow, great troubles, and terrible need. They 
        see hardly a star of hope through the dark clouds that cover Europe�s 
        sky. No one is able to dispel the despair they face. But in Germany, God 
        chose one from countless millions to speak our pain!
