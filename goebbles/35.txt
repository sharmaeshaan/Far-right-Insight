  It was a provocation the likes of which Berlin had never seen.

      Marxism thinks it presumptuous if a person with nationalistic

      sentiments expresses them in a working class district. And in

      Wedding And the Pharus Hall?  that was the uncontested domain of the K.P.D. 
        It was an open declaration of war. We meant it that way and

      the opponent understood it that way. Our party members were jubilant.

      Everything was now at stake. The future of the Berlin movement

      would be risked boldly and bravely. It was win or lose!The decisive day of 11 February We had no idea of the danger that threatened us then. I myself

      did not yet know Marxism well enough to foresee the possible

      consequences. I shrugged my shoulders as I read the dark prose

      of the red press and awaited expectantly the decisive evening.Around 8 p.m. we drove in an old rusty car from the city center

      to Wedding. A cold gray mist hung under a starless sky. Our hearts

      were bursting with impatience and expectation.As we drove down Müllerstraße it was already clear

      that the evening did not bode well. Groups of dark figures stood

      on every street corner. They apparently planned to teach our

      party members a bloody lesson before they even got to the meeting.Dark masses of people stood outside the Pharus Hall, expressing

      their rage and hate with loud and impudent threats.The leader of the protective forces cleared a way for us and

      reported briefly that the hall had been packed since 7:15 p.m.

      and had been closed by police. About two-thirds of the audience

      were Red Front fighters. That was what we wanted. There would

      be a decision. We were ready to give it all we had.Entering the hall, we encountered a warm, stiffling aroma

      of beer and tobacco. The hall was hot. A lively roar of voices

      filled the hall. People were packed in tightly. We reached the

      podium only with difficulty.No sooner was I recognized than hundreds of voices filled with rage and 
        revenge thundered in my ears: “Bloodhound! Murderer of workers!” 
        Those were the mildest words they shouted. But a welcoming group of some 
        party members and S.A. Men answered with passion. Excited battle cries 
        sounded from the platform. I saw immediately that we were a minority, 
        but a minority determined to fight, and therefore win.It was still our custom then for an S.A. leader to chair all

      of the party’s public meetings. Here too. Tall as a tree he stood

      up front and asked for silence with his upraised arm. That was

      easier said than done. Mocking laughter was the answer. Insults

      flew toward the platform from every corner of the room. People

      growled and screamed and raged. There were world revolutionaries

      scattered about who apparently had gained the courage they needed

      by drinking. It was impossible to quiet the hall. The class-conscious

      proletariat had not come to discuss but to fight, to break things

      up, to put an end to the Fascist specter with callused workers’

      fists.We were not uncertain, even for a moment. We also knew that

      if the enemy did not succeed this time in what he had threatened,

      the future success of the movement in Berlin was assured.Fifteen or twenty S.A. and S.S. men stood before the platform

      in uniforms and arm bands, an impudent and direct provocation

      to the Red Front fighters. Behind me was a select group of reliable

      people ready at any moment to risk their lives to defend me from

      the onrushing red mob with brutal forceThe communists made an obvious mistake in their tactics. They had scattered 
        small groups throughout the hall, but clumped most of the rest in the 
        right rear of the hall. I recognized immediately that there was the center 
        of unrest, and if anything was to be done, we first had to deal ruthlessly 
        with it. Whenever the chair tried to open the meeting, a dark chap stood 
        up on a stool and shouted “Point of Order!” Hundreds of others 
        yelled the same after him.If one takes from the mass their leader, or also their seducer, they 
        are leaderless and easily controlled. Our tactic therefore was to silence 
        this cowardly troublemaker at any cost. He felt secure back there, surrounded 
        by his comrades. We tried to do this peacefully a few times. The chair 
        shouted over the uproar: “There will be discussion afterward! But 
        we determine the rules of order!”That was an ineffective attempt at an unsuitable object. The

      screamer wanted to throw the meeting into confusion by his endless

      shouts and bring things to the boiling point. Then a general

      melee would result.As our efforts to bring the meeting to order peacefully proved unsuccessful, 
        I took the head of the defensive forces to the side, and immediately after 
        groups of his men slipped through the thundering communist masses. Before 
        the astonished and surprised Red Front troops realized what was happening, 
        our comrades had hauled the troublemaker down from his stool and brought 
        him through the raging crowd to the podium. That was unexpected, but what 
        followed was no surprise. A beer glass flew through the air and crashed 
        to the floor. That was the signal for the first major meeting hall battle. 
        Chairs were broken and legs ripped from tables. Glasses and bottles suddenly 
        appeared and all hell broke loose. The battle raged for ten minutes. Glasses, 
        bottles, table and chair legs flew randomly through the air. A deafening 
        roar rose; the red beast was set free and wanted its victims.At first it looked as if we were lost. The communist attack was sudden 
        and explosive, completely unexpected. But soon the S.A. and S.S. men distributed 
        throughout the hall and in front of the platform recovered from their 
        surprise and counterattacked with bold courage. It quickly became clear 
        that although the Communist Party had masses behind it, these masses became 
        cowards when faced with a firmly disciplined and determined opponent. 
        They ran. In short order the red mob that had come to break up our meeting 
        had been driven from the hall. The order that could not be secured by 
        good will was gained by brute force.Usually one is not aware of the stages of a meeting hall battle.

      Only later does one recall them. I still remember a scene that

      I will never forget; on the podium stood a young S.A. man whom

      I did not know. He was hurling his missiles into the on-coming

      red mob. Suddenly a beer glass thrown from the distance hit him

      on the head. A wide stream of blood ran down his face. He sank

      with a cry. After a few seconds he stood up again, grabbed water

      bottle from the table and threw it into the hall, where it clattered

      against the head of an opponent.The face of this young man is engraved in my memory. This

      lightning-fast moment is unforgettable. This gravely-wounded

      S.A. man would soon, and indeed for all times, become my most

      reliable and loyal comrade.Only after the red mob had been driven howling, growling and

      cursing from the field could one tell how serious and costly

      the battle had been. Ten lay in their blood on the platform,

      most with head injuries, two with severe concussions. The table

      and stairs to the platform were covered in blood. The whole hall

      resembled a field of ruins.In the midst of this bloody and ruined wasteland, our tree-high

      S.A. leader resumed his place and declared with iron calm: “The

      meeting will continue. The speaker has the floor.”Never before or since have I spoken under such dramatic conditions.

      Behind me, groaning in pain and bleeding, were seriously injured

      S.A. comrades. Around me were broken chair legs, shattered beer

      glasses and blood. The whole meeting was icily silent.We lacked then a medical corps. Since we were in a proletarian

      district, we had to have our seriously wounded carried out by

      so-called worker volunteers. There were scenes outdoors of unimaginable

      inhumanity. The bestial people who were supposedly fighting for

      universal brotherhood insulted our poor and defenseless injured

      with phases like: “Isn’t that pig dead yet?”Under such conditions it was impossible to give a coherent speech. Scarcely 
        had I begun to speak when another group of volunteers entered the hall 
        to carry off a seriously wounded S.A. man on a stretcher. One of them, 
        encountering the brutal apostles of humanity outside the door and their 
        unflattering and crude language, shouted for me in desperation. His voice 
        could be heard loudly and unmistakably on the platorm I interrupted my 
        speech and went through the hall, where there were still scattered communist 
        commando groups. Still surprised by what had happened, they stood quietly 
        and shyly to the side. I bade farewell to the seriously wounded S.A. comrades.At the end of my speech, I spoke for the first time of the

      unknown S.A. man.An amusing and satisfying episode of this bloody battle should

      also be mentioned. When the discussion period was announced,

      a pathetic chap who claimed to be a member of the Young German

      Order stood up. He gave an emotional appeal for brotherhood and

      peace between the classes, and complained passionately about

      the useless immorality of all this bloodshed, and announced that

      only in unity was there strength. As he then bowed to the meeting

      and prepared to launch into a patriotic poem to conclude his

      noble nonsense, the crowd laughed loudly when an honest S.A.

      man made the appropriate interruption: “Shut up, you little

      birthday orator!”That amusing intermezzo brought the battle of the Pharus Hall

      to an end. The police had cleared the street outside. The S.A.

      and S.S. left without any difficulty. A decisive day in the history

      of the National Socialist movement in Berlin was behind us.
