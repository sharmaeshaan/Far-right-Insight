 The picture of Goebbels is taken from the book. The picture

      of the Propaganda Ministry comes from a 1937 postcard.It takes only five minutes to walk from Postdamer Straße 109 in
         Berlin to the Wilhelmplatz. Five minutes from the more than modest first
         business office of the newly-named National Socialist It took Dr. Joseph Goebbels six and one half years to cover

      the distance. It led him through the middle of the Red hell of

      Berlin.Dr. Goebbels came to Berlin in 1926 on Adolf Hitler’s orders

      to reorganize the Berlin party, which was at the edge of collapse.

      He came alone. He came as a fighter who had proved himself against

      the French, separatists and Communists in three years in the

      Rhine and Ruhr areas. He came without support; he had to build

      his own support.A few years later the Red lords of Berlin had to build their

      courage against Adolf Hitler’s ambassador, who had come alone,

      with the slogan “Berlin remains Red!” It was too late

      by then, for the The NSDAP won twelve seats in the Reichstag in the May, 1928 election. 
        Dr. Goebbels was one of the twelve. Adolf Hitler named him the National 
        Propaganda Leader of the NSDAP. Two and a half years later, on 14 September 
        1930, the National Socialists came to the Reichstag with 107 men. And 
        on 30 January 1933, after the unique evening mass meeting of hundreds 
        of thousands, Dr. Goebbels could with pleasure tell the newly-named Reich 
        Chancellor that the Berlin movement had organized the event.When Reich President von Hindenburg appointed the National

      Propaganda Leader of the NSDAP the Minister for Public Enlightenment

      and Propaganda, this man who already had behind him the battles

      in the Rhineland and Berlin as well as enormous accomplishments

      in the party leadership, was the youngest minister: only 36!It is but five minutes from the dark and smoky business office of 1926, 
        which had the mocking name opium den, to the Leopold Palace. The road 
        took Dr. Joseph Goebbels through a sea of poison and hate and lies. Each 
        old follower of Adolf Hitler, each old National Socialist, had to withstand 
        battles that no young party member will have to endure, no matter how 
        long he lives. But no one had to face as much hate as Dr. Goebbels.It was almost open season on Dr. Goebbels during the six-and-a-half year 
        battle for Berlin. At first he was called the “Chief Crook of Berlin” 
        by the Communists  a title he accepted without embarrassment and 
        made a title of honor. Soon the middle class newspapers and speakers declared 
        open season on him too. He is a man of sharp phrases and pitiless language. 
        The danger he represented had long been recognized. The entire artillery 
        of the political battle, for which any means is justified, was turned 
        on him.It also seemed easy to fight a man who was under the constant

      fire of the state prosecutors of the day. There seemed no risk

      in dumping piles of filth on the editor of a newspaper that held

      the record for the number of times it was banned. No German newspaper

      was in fact banned as often as Berlin’s The results of the unprecedentedly bitter battle the organs

      of the Weimar state and the parties were different than they

      had expected: He hardened his weapons in the fire of this battle,

      and the masses his enemies attempted to mobilize against him

      instead joined him. It is not surprising that those who feared

      the oncoming National Socialism attacked with poison and gall.

      It is surprising that this man, mocked, ridiculed, and insulted

      as no one else, did not fall into deep despair and spiritual

      misery after those years of struggle.What most surprised his opponents is his disarming honesty.

      One accused him with contempt of being a propagandist, of being

      dishonest. The charge was loaded with the contempt and accusations

      of dishonesty that had been earned by years of bad propaganda.What did Dr. Goebbels do?He said: “Propaganda? Certainly! Good propaganda for

      a good cause!” We make propaganda not in the pay of  men in
      the background, but rather we make propaganda for our own

      honest convictions. We advertise for our own ideal, and therefore

      we fight using all good means to make good propaganda to win

      the soul of our people.”Eugen Hadamovsky, the The feared sharpness of Dr. Goebbels’s language was a result

      of his honesty. At a time when the word “lie,“Or even

      the direct term “liar” were thought unrefined and unusable

      in the columns of the German press, although they carried lies

      in their columns, Dr. Goebbels did not hesitate to call one who

      lied a liar. When it is necessary to call things by their proper

      name, when it is necessary to expose persons, then things are

      called by their name and people are presented in such a way that

      even a dog will no longer take a bone from them. The journalist

      and speaker Dr. Goebbels did not change his impolite methods,

      even when he faced a certain ban or a certain legal process.His honesty and determined stubbornness use a language and

      manner of expression that display crystal clear clarity and irresistible

      logic. His clarity of thought won him the respect of international

      journalists in Geneva in 1933, certainly the toughest, most hard-boiled

      audience. It is impressive that, after Minister Dr. Goebbels’s

      speech in Geneva, the correspondent of the Paris In everything there is a good portion of humor. Dr. Goebbels drew from 
        humor the sharpness of irony, once the scourge of Red Berlin. And satire, 
        too, came from humor, which drove many an opponent to lose his head.A flood of clever ideas came from his humor. Remember, for example, Dr. 
        Goebbels’ humorous success with Brüning! Dr. Goebbels had challenged 
        the then Reich Chancellor over and over again to a debate.Brüning preferred to speak in carefully prepared meetings. Dr. Goebbels 
        had a recording of the Brüning’s radio speech in Königsberg, 
        and took it to the Berlin Sport Palace to debate an opponent who was unwilling 
        to appear in any other way.Those are the weapons that served the faithful National Socialism

      of Dr. Joseph Goebbels in the battle for Berlin and the battle

      for Germany. Armed with these weapons, he succeeded everywhere

      he attacked. If one asked a journalist, regardless of the camp

      in which he stood, who was the best German journalist, one would

      get the answer, however reluctant: Dr. Goebbels. In an era when

      hundreds of German newspapers had given upon the familiar old

      institution of the lead article, since its old platitudes no

      longer found readers, Dr. Goebbels wrote his lead articles 

      and they were read. He wrote in a language that captivated the

      reader, who otherwise looked only for sensation. If one asked

      for the name of a great speaker in the Reichstag, honest people

      answered that no one since Friedrich Naumann so held the attention

      of the Reichstag as Dr. Joseph Goebbels.That is what is unique about him: Dr. Goebbels says what he

      has to say in the way that it must be said to those to whom he

      is speaking. Hundreds, even thousands of politicians travel about

      giving the only speech than can give, using the only language

      that they know how to use  regardless of whether they stand

      in the Reichstag or before a mass meeting or in a political salon.

      Dr. Goebbels speaks every language. He is at home in the north

      of Berlin as he is in the west of Berlin. He can be understood

      by the average man and the educated. He speaks to the people

      in mass meetings, to the representatives in the Reichstag. Once,

      long before the beginning of the church’s renewal at the time

      when the The official building he took over, the old Leopold Palace,

      had long been the seat of the Press Office of the Reich government.

      It was dark and musty. Dark carpets and curtains carried the

      dust of years. Only the Garden Room was cheerful and bright.

      But for years the representatives of the German press had heard

      there only the peculiar wishes of changing Reich governments;

      it was not a place with pleasant memories.After Dr. Goebbels had been in office for a few days, the

      dusty old hangings had been removed from the majority of the

      rooms, and simple, but friendly furniture filled bright rooms.

      When Dr. Goebbels spoke for the first time to representatives

      of the German press in the Garden Room of the Leopold Palace,

      no one failed to see that the evil spirit of a press hostile

      to the people had been forever driven out.“There are two ways to make a revolution,” the newly-named

      Reich Minister said. “One can fire at the opponent with

      machine guns until he recognizes the superiority of those who

      have the machine guns. That is the simplest way. One can also

      transform a nation through a revolution of the spirit, not destroying

      the opponent, but winning him over. We National Socialists have

      gone the second way, and will continue on it. Our first task

      in this ministry will be to win the whole people for the new

      state. We want to replace liberal thinking with a sense of community

      that includes the whole people.”Most memorable, however, was a style of speaking never before

      been heard in this room: “Our revolution will never stop.”Thus Dr. Goebbels began his task of being the constant intermediary

      between the National Socialist Reich government that sprang from

      the people, and the people. At every moment and in each individual

      measure, the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda

      should maintain the living relationship between government and

      people. “We have not become a minister to be above the people,

      but rather we are now more than ever the servant of the people.”The Propaganda Ministry is not bureaucratic administrative apparatus, 
        but rather an spiritual center of power that stays in constant touch with 
        the whole people on political, spiritual, cultural, and economic matters. 
        It is the mouth and ear of the Reich government.Dr. Goebbels laid his hand on all the powers that once made

      common front against him and against the idea of Adolf Hitler

      that he represented. On radio, the press, literature, theater,

      film. On the whole enormous apparatus of propaganda that once

      in the Reich capital used the whole of its enormous power to

      make the unknown but dangerous Dr. Goebbels from the Rhineland

      into a dreamer and crackpot, the subject of public scorn. The

      same enormous apparatus that some others, using enormous millions

      had attempted to influence without having any real success; for

      decades only one had dominated it, the Jewish intellect.This multifaceted apparatus of modern propaganda, which Dr.

      Goebbels had faced without the weapon of money, only with the

      strength of the idea even though the struggle seemed foolish,

      fell into the hands of the people that Dr. Goebbels, as a colleague

      of the Führer, had mobilized against this citadel of Jewish

      power.Now he can begin the reconstruction of German spiritual life

      after the foreign elements have been eliminated.Even during the very first beginnings of the work on building

      the ministry, the new Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment

      and Propaganda could give the first evidence of what it was capable

      of: The organization of the first Day of National Labor, 1 May

      1933. Although its success was surpassed by 1 May 1934, Dr. Goebbels

      showed then for the first time that once the path was made clear

      for National Socialism, not hundreds of thousands, but rather millions

      could gather at a single place when it called.Relatively little had to be changed in 1934 on the Day of

      Labor after the example of 1 May 1933. Organizationally, it had

      been done right the first time. The tradition had been created,

      and after a year one could assume that the content German national

      holiday needed only to be deepened. The waves of the first May

      mass meeting rolled over the many unions and parties. 1 May awoke

      old May customs in all the German Department III, Radio (Ministerialrat Dreßler-Andreß)

      unites the whole of the German radio system.The radio, once a collection of private broadcasters in which

      the influence of the Reich, the states, political parties and

      private concerns battled, was united, cleansed and clearly organized.

      The radio was not only placed under National Socialist control,

      but also reconstructed on National Socialist lines.The new people’s radio has proven that it is able literally to draw a 
        whole nation to the receiver for some “big events.” Occurrences 
        such as the state visit of the Führer and Reich Chancellor to Hamburg 
        on 17 August 1934 have shown that the new German radio can make such events 
        festivals for the whole nation. The radio allowed a whole nation to participate 
        in the ceremony of the German Reichstag for the deceased Reich President, 
        and the world followed as the General Field Marshal found his final resting 
        place on the field of his greatest victory.A year after Dr. Goebbels had taken the German radio in his hand, it 
        was possible at noon on the first day of spring that not even three people 
        could be seen at a major point in Berlin, the Potsdamer Platz, because 
        the Führer was opening the second great battle for work in Bavaria. 
        He was speaking to a few thousand, but he spoke over the radio to millions 
        and millions. The new radio system, even at a time when the economic crisis 
        had not been completely overcome, was able to win millions of new listeners 
        and produce millions of new receivers, above all the Without exaggerating, one can say that there is no country

      in the world where the radio is anywhere near as intensive an

      intermediary between the government and the people as in Germany.A true labor of Sisyphus was necessary in the area of the

      press. From the chaos of 3500 German newspapers, of which only

      120 were National Socialist in 1932, a responsible German press

      had to be created.Department IV, the Press (Ministerialrat Dr. Jahnke) is the

      tool of the Propaganda Ministry in this area. It is simultaneously

      the Press Office of the Reich government. Its head is the Assistant

      Press Chief of the Reich government, State Secretary Walter Funk

      of the Reich Ministry for People’s Enlightenment and Propaganda.The destructive effects of the past liberal era had especially

      serious effects on the German newspaper system. Anyone, even

      foreigners and those foreign to the German spirit, could with

      no regard for the people or the state write whatever he wanted

      about any political question, even if that which he wrote offered

      foreign opponents all possible support and aid.Bans could not help deal with the general decay of the German

      newspaper system. They are only a temporary means to deal with

      the worst manifestations. Dr. Goebbels therefore created the

      new Editor’s Law, which laid the foundation for a complete transformation

      of the German newspaper system in the moral, political, and economic

      areas. The law gave the German editor major rights, but also

      major duties.The German editor is now the representative of the

      whole people, and must as such give account for all his actions

      and inactions. For the first time in the world, this law makes

      the interests of the people and the state the supreme law for

      the whole press.Some foreign newspapers thought this was the end of press

      freedom. Within a year, even those abroad realized that true

      freedom stabilizes a decent and nationally-conscious journalist

      class.Department IV, which supports the press, holds a daily press

      conference. It provides constant information for the never-ending

      work of domestic and foreign newspapers, news agencies and correspondents.It also incorporates the Drahloser Dienst, the news agency

      of the German radio that provides all Reich stations with news

      and broadcasts as well in four languages over shortwave.Since the most modern ministry works with the most modern

      methods, the Drahtlosen Dienst has an excellent teletype system

      that transmits its news to all German stations in a form ready

      for broadcast.Department V (Ministerialrat Dr. Seeger) is responsible for

      all matters regarding the film system, the film industry and

      film technology.Department VI (Ministerialrat Laubinger) handles the broad

      areas of theater, music, and the arts.Department VII (Ministerialrat Demann) is responsible finally

      for defense.That is the staff that the Reich Minister for People’s Enlightenment

      and Propaganda called to work closely with the National Socialist

      Party leadership. From here come the new slogans for the people,

      who are to be formed into a new unity and set to the work of

      reconstruction.It is surprising how rapidly Dr. Goebbels became a cultural

      organizer after the years of struggle. He succeeded in bringing

      order to the most difficult of all areas of public life, culture,

      in the form of the Reich Chamber of Culture.The Reich Chamber of Culture includes the Reich Chamber of

      Film, the Reich Chamber of the Visual Arts, the Reich Chamber

      of Theater, the Reich Chamber of Radio, the Reich Chamber of

      the Press, the Reich Chamber of Music, and the Reich Chamber

      of Literature.In these chambers, all those German creators of culture are

      united in a rational manner and without unnecessary compulsion

      in the place where they can most effectively work for cultural

      reconstruction.Speaking to the presidents of the specialized chambers of

      the Reich Chamber of Culture, Dr. Goebbels explained: “If

      professional thinking is really the great sociological idea of

      the Twentieth Century, then Germany is breaking new ground.”

      Dr. Goebbels discussed the foundation of the National Socialist

      state: Art is free, and one may never attempt to replace a lack

      of intuition with organization. He warned against bureaucratizing

      the Chamber of Culture. He explained its duties in this way:

      “It is a fundamental mistake to think that the task of the

      Reich Chamber of Culture is to produce art. It cannot, it will

      not, and it may not. Its task is to bring culture-creating people

      together, to organize them, to remove the restrictions and contradictions

      that surface and to assist in administering existing art, the

      art being produced today, and the art that will be produced in

      the future for the benefit of the German people.”Dr. Goebbels, who came to know writers, journalists, theater

      agents, film managers, politicians and so on during the years

      of struggle, is at home in these areas. To film producers who

      complained about a lack of material, he replied: “There

      is no shortage of material, but rather the courage to use it is lacking.”

      To the press he said: “The more unified the national ability

      of a people to concentrate is, the more effective national discipline

      will be.” Speaking of the tasks of German theater: “We

      do not want the pendulum of the times to stop at the door of

      the theater, but rather that it strike deep into every artist’s soul,

      and the artist does not merely see the new era as an unpleasant

      but unavoidable necessity, but rather that he understands the time

      and sees in it a powerful national drama of historic-artistic

      scale, an event that will give impulse, material and drive to

      German artists for three or four generations.”Or as he said to booksellers: “As long as the book remains

      the privilege of a small, elite class and does not find reception

      by the people, one will not be able to speak of real benefits

      to the nation through the book.”It is obvious that the creative artist Joseph Goebbels is a bitter enemy 
        of any form of For each German, ethnicity must be the decisive reality. From this ground 
        and no other, creative artistic and cultural forces must rise. The deeper 
        art’s roots are in the soil of the nation, the greater will be its international 
        significance.
