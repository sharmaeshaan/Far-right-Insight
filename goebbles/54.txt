 The map 
        Goebbels discusses was, in fact, On 28 October, more than a month ago, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
        gave a radio speech that apparently had as its goal plunging the American 
        people into uncertainty and panic, thus to prepare gradually for the fateful 
        intervention which the American president desires, regardless of American 
        public opinion. The speech differed from all of his previous speeches 
        in that Roosevelt did not limit himself to the almost traditional and 
        unconscionable and slanderous attacks on the Führer and National 
        Socialist Germany. This time he made concrete accusations against the 
        policies of the Reich, which he attempted to prove though compromising 
        documents he allegedly possessed.Mr. Roosevelt claimed that he had proof in his hands that the Axis powers 
        were planning to reorganize South and Central America. They were planning 
        to transform the existing fourteen countries into five states that would 
        be under their control. His proof was a secret map allegedly produced 
        by the Reich government. The American government also claims to possess 
        another Reich document. According to it, the Reich government plans to 
        abolish the existing religions of the world once it has won the war  
        Catholicism, Protestantism, Mohammedanism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism. 
        They are to be replaced by an international National Socialist church, 
        the cross by the swastika, and God by the Führer. That is what he 
        claims.It is clear to us that Mr. Roosevelt needed this grand swindle

      to whip up American public opinion. He needed the heaviest possible

      ammunition, since the American people are at the moment more

      intelligent than their government and want absolutely nothing

      to do with the war in Europe. We really are not all that interested

      in Mr. Roosevelt’s opinion of the intelligence of his people

      nor in what he thinks them capable of believing, and normally

      would see no need to reply to his bald-faced and outrageous lies

      which so clearly bear the signs of fabrication. In this case,

      however, it is a matter of a political falsification which seems

      to us to have a clear and ominous purpose, and gave us such an

      easy chance to show up the liars to the entire world that we

      could hardly let the opportunity pass. We had to overcome our

      moral scruples, however, to confront the liar and ask him where

      he got these alleged documents from, where they can be found,

      and if he was ready to show them to the public.Things went as we expected. Mr. Roosevelt, the president of

      a nation of 130 million, dodged our questions. He claimed the

      authenticity of the documents was unassailable; he had them.

      They could not be published, however, since they were secret

      and publishing them would reveal the source. And the map in question

      that carved up Central and South America had markings in pencil

      that could compromise the source that provided them. He, Roosevelt,

      did not want to cause any difficulties for the poor chap who

      passed them along.Would that we had such a president! He is a well-meaning soul who cares 
        for his scoundrels. Given his speeches and actions, he would not hesitate 
        to send hundreds of thousands of soldiers to the battlefield, even perhaps 
        sacrificing them in service to his crazy plans of conquest, but the thought 
        of causing a fine and honorable traitor any trouble breaks his heart. 
        As one can imagine, Roosevelt’s answer was not very convincing proof of 
        his hair-raising allegations either at home or abroad. Our tough questions 
        bore fruit. We used the press and radio to propose to the American president 
        that he might publish the incriminating map of Central and South America, 
        perhaps either erasing the ominous pencil markings or covering them up 
        with paper, or to at least publish the text of our notorious plan to begin 
        a campaign against all the world’s religions once the war was over, from 
        Jehovah to Confucius to Christ.Mr. Roosevelt sank into silence, saying nothing at all. Only one of his 
        creatures, the former Argentinean bordello-owner and pimp Taborda, who 
        happened to be visiting him at the time, said that he had been able to 
        sneak a look at the map, and that all was as Mr. Roosevelt had said. More 
        he could not say, since he had given his word of honor.One can understand our reluctance to consider the word of

      honor of so dubious an underworld figure as absolutely convincing.

      We looked further, and since we could learn nothing more given

      the stubborn silence of the accuser, we attempted to lure him

      into a response by massive attacks. Alas, the normally talkative

      gentleman seemed to have forgotten how to speak. Even the attempts

      of the American press to learn something more as he visited one

      of the famous skyscrapers were in vain.The Reich government published two formal denials on 1 November, which 
        boxed Roosevelt’s ears so strongly that he had to chose between revealing 
        his documents or proving himself a forger and liar to the entire world. 
        He chose the latter. The U.S. press gave headline treatment to the German 
        denials and asked for a response. Mr. Roosevelt accepted the blows, rubbed 
        his cheeks, and said nothing. We made every conceivable suggestion to 
        ease the publication of the documents, but the U.S. president preferred 
        to be thought a liar and forger than to prove his absurd accusations.That’s the way things are. We do not flatter ourselves by believing that 
        we have some way to force Mr. Roosevelt to speak. He apparently has every 
        reason to hope the matter will be forgotten. When he made his charges, 
        one could perhaps generously grant that he believed them. It was at least 
        possible that he had been the victim of some sort of swindle and had believed 
        in the documents’ authenticity. That is no longer possible, for if he 
        had been acting honestly he would have provided the evidence supporting 
        his accusations. He has not done so. That is sufficient proof that he 
        was not the victim of a forgery, but rather that he himself was directly 
        or indirectly involved. This is a matter of war and peace, and the American 
        public has every right to examine its president and his actions, to ask 
        him about these documents, why Mr. Roosevelt has not published them, whether 
        he still stands by his speech of 28 October, and what he plans to do to 
        restore the damage done to his reputation by the two German denials that 
        accuse him of forgery.One always feels the need to wash one’s hands after being forced to deal 
        with the methods of U.S. interventionism. It is so unpleasant and filthy 
        that one shudders. When one hears the pious nonsense of the Jewish-led 
        world plutocracy over the radio or reads it in the press, one need only 
        to look behind the scenes to feel pity for the miseries of mankind. That 
        such a man has the impudence to judge us, to call on God and the world 
        as witnesses of the purity of his deeds, to incite war and send innocent 
        people singing “Onward Christian Soldiers” to battle for his 
        filthy financial interests can only fill anyone with even the most primitive 
        sense of decency with the deepest horror. Were there only such people 
        in the world, one would have to despise humanity.Mr. Roosevelt is Churchill’s accomplice, but apparently reckons that 
        in the case of England’s defeat a respectable portion of Britain’s possessions 
        will be left over. Thus he rushes to war despite the opposition of public 
        opinion in a manner incomprehensible to those not familiar with democratic 
        countries. Whatever policy he may follow, he is no longer able to change 
        England’s fate in this war. If Mr. Roosevelt does not want to accept our 
        argument, he might at least consider that we are unlikely to attack the 
        American continent because it simply is not feasible. This must be clear 
        to him, since it is equally infeasible for the Americans to attack us. 
        As far as American armaments go, they are first not up to the quality 
        of those in Europe, much less better. Second, the American material must 
        cross the insecure Atlantic to reach England. We, on the other hand, can 
        receive everything that we ourselves do not produce over secure rail lines 
        from every nation of Europe.Even in America the trees do not reach the heavens. We can tell which 
        of our enemy’s threats are serious and which are bluffs. We do not underestimate 
        the United States, but neither do we overestimate it. If Mr. Roosevelt 
        succeeds in provoking war, he will find its reality considerably less 
        pleasant than his fantasies. We will follow his continuing machinations 
        with stoic calm. Here, too, the food is hotter on the stove than on the 
        plate.
