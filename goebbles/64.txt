 The war has reached a stage at which the enemy seems willing to use any 
        means to change the currently unfavorable, even desperate, situation, 
        and to bring about at least an acceptable conclusion. Seldom in the history 
        of human warfare has there been a struggle for existence between peoples 
        that was so unbalanced as this one. The Axis powers can look back on a 
        long, almost unbroken, even breathtaking series, of proud victories, while 
        the enemy can look back on misfortune after misfortune and defeat after 
        defeat. Future historians will wonder how it was possible for their peoples 
        to believe in a good outcome and a coming victory, despite eternal defeats 
        along the way. The only explanation for their peculiar thinking is that 
        their powers of judgment have been blinded by unscrupulous and lying propaganda.The military possibilities remaining for the plutocratic-Bolshevist coalition 
        seem extraordinarily limited at the moment. Those in London, Washington, 
        and Moscow seek to cover themselves with clouds of mystery and respond 
        to probing questions from large parts of their public with dark and threatening 
        hints, but any knowledgeable observer knows that nothing is behind their 
        words. They are caught in their own trap. The war they so carefully prepared 
        is beginning to turn against them. They are able to do damage to their 
        hated enemy, to attack his possessions or the working districts of his 
        cities and villages, but that no longer is able to alter the war situation. 
        Things are following their own laws.Someone other than Mr. Churchill will have to rule England if London 
        is not to seek to accomplish through blind and destructive terror that 
        which it cannot achieve by fair and decent warfare. British newspapers 
        are currently writing about the bombing attacks with unsurpassed cynicism. 
        These discussions give us good insight into the English national character, 
        as well as an extraordinarily educational picture of that which would 
        befall us were we to fall into the hands of the British-plutocratic ruling 
        class. Thank God, what we see with brutal clarity is not a sign of strength, 
        but rather of weakness and impotent rage. He who insults and threatens is 
        always in the wrong. We have never thought it necessary to predict a dark 
        and infernal end for England. We do know that its historical mistakes 
        can lead to historical catastrophes. We also never threatened random bombing 
        warfare against the civilian population for reasons of revenge or dark 
        hatred. We will defend ourselves with the means that the enemy forces 
        on us.It is different with Mr. Churchill. He is apparently raging mad over 
        his previous military defeats, and despite all the shouting is unable 
        to open a second front in Europe to take the pressure off the Soviets. 
        Were there even the least chance of that, his adventurous nature would 
        surely make him seize the opportunity. Aside from everything else, he 
        lacks the shipping tonnage. He knows as well as we that an attempted landing 
        anywhere in Europe would quickly provide England with a second, and far 
        worse, Dunkirk. He cannot risk such a defeat without causing a fatal crisis 
        for the Empire. Given the increasing demands by the Bolshevists, he has 
        no choice but to make dark threats and find less dangerous ways to satisfy 
        the Soviets. His solution is to send the Royal Air Force on night attacks 
        on the German civilian population.We have never doubted that this type of warfare could do us serious damage. 
        The question is whether it is able to significantly change the military 
        situation, and if the results that Mr. Churchill promises can be achieved 
        to any significant degree. I do not need to say that the German civilian 
        population is suffering grievously under British terror. They know that 
        they have the sympathy and warm support of the entire German people, who 
        greatly admire their brave struggle. But London is mistaken if it believes 
        it can by terror break German morale. We have said it a hundred times 
        before and will say it a hundred times again: today’s German people has 
        nothing in common with the German people of 1918. Our morale breakdown 
        then was a one-time exception, not the rule.As nonsensical is the British presumption that one can seriously damage 
        our armaments or foodstuffs production through such terroristic air attacks. 
        The damage done is not sufficient to impair our war effort. If the British 
        knew what they actually destroyed during their night attacks but rather 
        than what they think they have destroyed, they would not place so high 
        a value on the air war. They suffer enormous losses during their night 
        missions. The losses are greater than they can sustain, even if Mr. Churchill 
        fudges the figures by exaggerating the number of planes involved to reduce 
        the percentage of planes lost. He can score some political points at home 
        by doing this, but he cannot fool us. The enemy is not that choosy when 
        it comes to numbers. A total of 305 people died in the big British night 
        attack on Cologne on 30-31 MayFrom the start of the war until 1 June 1942, a total of 7,430 people 
        died during enemy bombing raids. We certainly do not want to downplay 
        the pain these deaths caused. They also died for the freedom of the Reich. 
        They stand in accusation before the English leadership, which has always 
        been characterized by cynical brutality and certainly is living up to 
        its reputation. However, the true scale of this number becomes clear when 
        one realizes that in the last two and half years of peace, 15,039 Germans 
        died in traffic accidents. We do not intend in any way to compare the 
        significance of the deaths, only to put British boasting in the proper 
        context.Reports from all the cities bombed by the English are that civilian morale 
        is holding firm. One hardly takes the pain caused by the terror attacks 
        lightly  how could one!  but one feels in the front lines 
        of our civil defense. People know precisely what Mr. Churchill is trying 
        to do, and have no desire to do him a favor by being weak. The British 
        strategy is too transparent to be successful, and besides that, the English 
        have been all too open about their goal. One cannot hope to break civilian 
        morale when one is cynical enough to announce that that is what one is 
        doing, particularly when people know exactly what the consequences of 
        weakness would be. Normally, the attacks England makes on us are returned 
        promptly and proportionately. We do not like to do so, but Mr. Churchill 
        leaves us no choice. The Führer warned him clearly in his last speech 
        to the Reichstag, but Mr. Churchill still chose random bombing, and he 
        will be paid back in the same coin. That is an unfortunate and painful 
        method of warfare for both sides, but he who began it bears the responsibility.Terror can be broken only by terror. Weakness only encourages and strengthens 
        it. Terror and counter-terror cost lives, but in numbers far lower than 
        would be the case if one gave in. Only force defeats force. As painful 
        as it is to people who appreciate culture  and we consider ourselves 
        a part of this slowly disappearing group  to see damage to such 
        ancient historical and artistic monuments not only in Lübeck, Rostock 
        and Cologne, but also in Bath, York, and Canterbury, it is not our fault, 
        but that of the ruthless criminal who currently heads the British Empire. 
        We know well enough that he lacks any sense for appreciating such things. 
        He is one of those hardened and crude plutocratic types whose sole ambitions 
        are money, the good life, and best of all, alcohol. It is England’s misfortune 
        to have him as its leader. Not only the British Empire, but the whole 
        of decent humanity must pay a dear price. Were it not for us, the world 
        of culture would vanish.We must therefore defend ourselves against his methods of warfare. Since 
        we are determined to use the same brutal methods he is using to terrorize 
        our civilian population, he will fail. His air war is above all a war 
        of nerves. He is trying to shatter the morale of the civilian population 
        in the areas subject to bombing. He does not care if it costs him more 
        than it costs us. He is making an attempt that will that will fail in 
        the same way as his other attempts. The sacrifices we must make will one 
        day be rewarded. We have no choice but to accept them, and to repay them 
        in kind as our world-wide war effort permits. The victims in England can 
        complain to the source of their troubles very easily: Mr. Churchill.It would do the Jewish press in New York and London too much

      honor to give any attention to their bloodthirsty commentaries

      on the air war and the war of nerves. They will have to pay for

      it with the extermination of their race in Europe, and perhaps

      far beyond. They are not to be taken seriously, for they represent

      their own interests, not those of England or America. We are

      waging war against enemies who threaten our very existence. We

      are fighting for everything dear to us. The war’s victims will

      one day stand in worthy comparison to the size of the victory

      we will achieve. That can no longer be altered. Our enemies are

      in a position to postpone our victory for a period of time. But

      that will make the end even more inevitable.Here, too, the old proverb is true: That which does not destroy us makes 
        us stronger.
