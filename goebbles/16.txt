Good treatments of the development of the Hitler myth are provided by 
        We Germans do not have sufficient historical distance to evaluate

      the full scope of the age in which we are living. We are children

      of our age. We have been formed by our age, and we in turn are

      forming it. It will be the task of later generations to evaluate

      it properly and to determine what is really admirable and what

      is simply normal. Future generations will surely envy the fact

      that we have lived a life of struggle, that we had the good fortune

      to have political passion, a passion that Heinrich von Treitschke

      once said finds little room in the hearts of most people.There are rare moments in the middle of the pressures of daily life when 
        we suddenly are struck by the feeling that everything before us is history, 
        and that a new world is now being born. We experience the birth pangs 
        of all that is young and new, and realize that this new world is replacing 
        the old and sinking one, with all its peculiarities, tenseness and prejudice. 
        If there are men who make history, if great historical developments are 
        the product of individual personalities, then the riddle of our era is 
        to be explained only by the grace of a brilliant human being. It is no 
        cliche to say that everything we experience today and for which we expend 
        our best energies would not be, or at least would be very different, were 
        it not for one man who forged the path and showed the way, giving meaning, 
        content, and direction to our age. We are experiencing the greatest miracle 
        that history offers: a genius is building a new world.When is this more evident than today, as the entire German nation and 
        countless millions beyond its borders send their thanks, their honor, 
        their admiration, their deepest hopes and their unshakable faith in him 
        and his historic mission, to the Führer on his 52nd birthday? They 
        are the feelings that most deeply move each German above all. There will 
        be in this hard year of war no noisy popular festivals, no parades, no 
        splendid public performances. But these feelings are expressed even more 
        deeply and warmly by those who do their daily duty, be it by our best 
        fighting men at the front or at home in the armaments industries. The 
        German people honors the Führer on his birthday by pledging redoubled 
        efforts to support his work. Our love and honor for him give wings to 
        our struggle and to our work for victory.Two years ago we celebrated his 50th birthday with the most

      splendid parade that the Reich capital had ever seen. The German

      people saw clearly for the first time how strong the Reich had

      become under six years of National Socialist government. We hoped

      then that the Führer’s efforts to preserve peace for our

      nation and the world would succeed. Already the fanfares of hatred

      were sounding from London and Paris, calling for war at any price.

      We knew that if our enemies once more forced the Reich to fight

      for its national existence, the German people for the first time

      in their history would be united in all their branches, prepared

      spiritually, economically and militarily, ready to present the

      world with a miracle of strength, manliness, sovereign political

      and spiritual superiority, military power and precision.Our eternal enemies declared war on us in September of that

      year, and since then the German miracle has become reality. The

      German soldier defeated the enemy wherever he met him. In breathtaking

      victories unique in history, brilliant offensives defeated Poland,

      Norway, Holland, Belgium and France. England has been thrown

      from the continent, and the British Empire is receiving powerful

      blows in the homeland, on the Atlantic and in North Africa that

      are shaking its foundations. If one asks how our enemies could

      declare war on the Reich under such conditions, the only answer

      is that they did not believe in the enormous power of a great

      personality nor in the strength of his work. They still thought

      of Germany as it had been in November 1918, cowardly, exhausted,

      defenseless against the false promises of its enemies, with no

      knowledge of its national mission and without determined and

      strong leadership. They did not think it possible that one man

      could bring about a miracle that would lift this people from

      the pit to which it had fallen and lead a wonderful regeneration

      that made it once more conscious of its strengths. Only rarely

      have the German people experienced a true national task. While

      other nations in the world did what was necessary to secure their

      political and economic security by establishing the necessary

      military bases and reserves of raw materials, we Germans poured

      out our blood chasing phantoms. For the first time in this war,

      Germany is a strong power, defending its interests, which are

      not the increased profits of a capitalist ruling class, but rather

      the preservation of its national existence.Each of us knows this today. We gave no illusions as we fight

      the war. We all know what it is about. We know that its outcome

      will determine our national life. We know that it must be won

      by the whole people for the whole people, and that a German victory

      will mean that the Reich is firmly guarded on all sides and that

      Germany’s national existence is secured. That will give our people

      the possibility to live and work politically and economically.Foreign visitors who visit the Reich during the war are amazed

      at the calm with which the German people look at current and

      coming events. Nothing would be more false than to assume this

      was the result of indifference of lack of interest. Our confidence

      rests on security. Our people do not know, and do not even want

      to know, what the Führer is planning and how he will gain

      victory. They simply trust him. He will chose the right way,

      as he has always done. Our people had no worries before the Western

      offensive as to how the Führer would break through the Maginot

      Line to attack France. They simply believed that he had a plan

      and the means. When Holland, Belgium and France were defeated

      within six weeks as the world held its breath, the German people

      were more pleased than surprised. They saw only renewed confirmation

      of their faith in the Führer. Our people know that if the

      nation is loyal, obedient and dutiful, and if each does his job,

      Germany is unbeatable and victory after victory will accompany

      our troops.What enormous strength lies in this confidence! How childish

      and silly, to the contrary, are the repeated stupid efforts by

      British plutocracy to shake this confidence, to bring the people

      in conflict with the Führer, to weaken the fighting spirit

      of our army by lying rumors. Every German soldier today knows

      that we have only been defeated when we succumbed to such a temptation,

      and that Germany has always been triumphant which it was conscious

      of its strength and directed it outwardly, not inwardly.The winter in which London placed such great hopes is long over. We filled 
        it with feverish preparations. The entire nation worked day and night 
        to supply our army with a surplus of weapons and munitions. The internal 
        organization of our national life continues to function flawlessly, and 
        the burdens war brings with it are fairly distributed and bearable for 
        everyone. The attempts of British plutocracy to win victories on the periphery 
        or to cause the German people to doubt or lose courage during the long 
        waiting period have been in vain. These attempts had no impact on us. 
        The German people did not only wait during the winter, they also fought 
        and worked. We did not make as much noise about it as did the English. 
        The enemy has already seen the results of our preparations in the campaign 
        in the Southeast, in North Africa, in the Battle of the Atlantic, and 
        in the air war against the English motherland. That all goes to show that 
        wars are not won through newspaper articles, but rather with ideas, soldiers, 
        weapons, and munitions. A people wins when it has the prerequisites to 
        victory, when it wants to win, and when it must win. All that is true 
        for us.This evening we look back along the path we have followed

      since September 1939, and forward to what is still shrouded in

      darkness, illuminated by the light of our faith. It is the path

      to final victory. We have never believed in it as firmly as we

      do today. The Führer leads us, and that is the best foundation

      of our confidence.When Mr. Churchill spoke recently about the outcome of this war, he declared 
        that England would win, he just did not know how. We reply: The Führer 
        will win because he also knows how he will win. He has filled the nation 
        with his spirit. It is tuned to his will. This time, they will survive 
        the great test of faith that will decide their future, ending the 400-year 
        series of German mistakes and failures. That is why this age is so great 
        for us Germans and why, despite the war, it is so encouraging. Our people 
        have a chance, one that we will use. An armed people, led by one will 
        and filled with fanaticism  that is victory!A man who has created such things stands far above any words

      of praise. The nation can only bow in thankfulness before him.

      We all do that in this hour. We thank the fate that sent us the

      Führer in the midst of our deepest need. We, his old fighting

      companions throughout the German Reich and our soldiers at the

      Front above all are grateful to fate that it gave us in our early

      years the strength and insight to recognize his greatness and

      to be with him from the beginning along his eventful way to victory

      and triumph. Who among us would chose to miss even one day of

      these last hard years, always filled with battle and work? Who

      among us does not think it his highest good fortune, indeed the

      real meaning and fulfillment of his life, to have been with him

      as he won the revolution, and to be with him now as he is winning

      the great war for Germany’s life and freedom? We have fought

      at his side long enough to know both from experience and knowledge

      that victory is as good as certain. We only must remain strong,

      faithful, brave and upright, striding with heads high toward

      the hour of our proudest triumph.Thus we greet him on the eve of his birthday. The entire nation

      joins in this greeting, and in expressing its deepest and most

      profound thankfulness for him. Our soldiers bear his names on

      their lips, wherever they may stand or march. Our workers sing

      his name as they work. Our men on the battle fronts, above all

      those in the Southeast and North Africa who defend the nation’s

      security, our officers and soldiers of the air force who carry

      death and destruction to the British Isles, our men in the navy

      who have set an iron ring around Great Britain, they all greet

      him as their supreme commander. Our farmers and workers greet

      him as their Führer and our women thank him for fighting

      for the future of their children. The German youth gives him

      their strongest faith. He is ours. He has made this people what

      it is today. Where would we be if he had not come?We ask a gracious God to keep him healthy and to grant success

      to his work for the freedom of our people. Then we need not fear

      the future. Then the German people can face the proudest period

      of their historical development. Once the flags of our revolution

      fluttered over the entire Reich. Now we long for that happy day,

      and fight for it with all our might, when the flags of our victory

      will fly over the entire Reich.Tomorrow we celebrate his fanatic devotion to his work. Despite the war, 
        a festive air fills the whole nation. It is his day, and it is our day. 
        It reminds us once more what our lives have become because of him. We 
        therefore wish him what we have always wished for: May he remain for us 
        what he was and is:
