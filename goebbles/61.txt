 Through a combination of ruthlessly sending food from the occupied territories 
        to Germany and a good harvest, food rations were significantly increased 
        in fall 1942. The new cuts in food rations that take effect on 6 April will have a 
        big impact in the household of every citizen. It would be foolish and 
        incorrect to ignore it or make it seem better than it is. The relevant 
        offices have thought long and hard about both the size and necessity of 
        the cut. They agree unanimously that the cuts are necessary now, and in 
        the planned amount. Had they not done so, it is likely that in six to 
        eight months we would have even greater problems with our food supply 
        that would require even larger cuts than are needed now.In contrast to the last war, German food policy has taken

      care to guarantee that the available food supplies are fairly

      distributed. Because of war conditions, the supply is not sufficient

      to meet everyone’s desires. Surely no one will hold it against

      the government if it does not allow food to be consumed today

      that may be absolutely necessary tomorrow to maintain our existence.

      We must manage our food supplies with a view to the long term,

      one that will permit us to wage war to its victorious conclusion.

      The government knows better than anyone else that reductions

      in food supplies affect directly the whole population. When it

      decides they are necessary, one may be sure that there is no

      other possibility.The reasons leading to this decision are well known. They have been thoroughly 
        discussed in the press and radio and do not need to be repeated here. 
        The size of our army, the increase in the number of workers in heavy industry 
        as well as those working overtime and nights, the 2.5 million workers 
        from abroad active mostly in German armaments production, the many millions 
        of prisoners who work for us, but who also have to be fed, assistance 
        for occupied regions supporting our military economy, help for our ally 
        Finland in its heroic struggle, the abnormal weather conditions of the 
        last two years that upset our plans and produced only average harvests, 
        and the chronic shortage of agricultural labor were together too much 
        for us to maintain the old ration levels.We, of course, know that it is not exactly a good time for a reduction 
        in rations. Potatoes are in short supply. The long-lasting frost has made 
        it impossible to get them to market. They will arrive in larger quantities 
        when spring finally arrives, but the long winter still has upset some 
        of our plans that looked good on paper. Vegetables are in short supply, 
        particularly in big cities. In short, we would have preferred to postpone 
        this tough measure for a few months. It was not possible. We do not determine 
        our food policies during the war on their popularity, but rather according 
        to what is reasonable under the conditions, even if it sometimes requires 
        unpleasant decisions. They may hurt, but we will maintain them until the 
        war ends victoriously. Most importantly, we cannot foresee the size of 
        the coming harvest, and must guarantee sufficient reserves. Depending 
        on the next harvest, we may later be able to consider improvements in 
        rations.No German doubts any longer that we must win the war. What

      we accept voluntarily today is child’s play compared to what

      would happen to us if we lose. We do not even consider such a

      possibility. The government does not only want to win, it is

      working and fighting for it, and has after all the ultimate responsibility

      for victory as well. It has the duty to do what the situation

      requires.The people, however, has every right to insist that the burdens of the 
        war be shared fairly. No one is exempt from the sacrifices that the nation 
        as a whole must bring to win the war. Anyone who interferes with or threatens 
        our war effort deserves the harshest penalties, even the death penalty. 
        So many fine soldiers and officers risk their lives for their fatherland 
        that one simply cannot allow someone at home to hurt our chances of victory, 
        whether intentionally or not. It is also clear that the harder the sacrifices 
        at the front, the heavier must be the burdens at home, and the more stringent 
        the insistence that order and fairness prevail at home. Those who break 
        the law must be ruthlessly called to account. Our soldiers understandably 
        demand that of us, and indeed the entire people surely gives such a policy 
        its full support.It is a matter of complete indifference to us what the enemy thinks about 
        it. They are advised to look to their own affairs. The gentlemen in England 
        are welcome to consider it a sign of our weakness that in this third year 
        of war we maintain order in public life and refuse to tolerate that anyone 
        profits from the general problems of our people. They are making the same 
        cuts in rations as we. Unlike the English food minister, we do not tell 
        the German people that meat is bad for them and that grass makes a good, 
        tasty salad. The English claim we are autocratic, but when we make so 
        critical a decision we turn confidently to the people, explain the situation 
        without covering anything up, and know that they will understand.We also protect the people from profiteers. Unlike the situation in England 
         the London newspapers complain nearly every day rather strongly 
        about it  we would not hesitate to hang such people. Our consciences 
        would not bother us in the least.It is therefore no accident that the Council for National Defense has 
        released a new directive recently that says in its first paragraph that 
        he who destroys, withholds, or hordes raw materials or foodstuffs important 
        to the population will receive a jail or prison term, or even in particularly 
        serious cases the death penalty. Those who in the course of their business 
        or trade give special preference to others in supplying goods or services, 
        or offer the same, will receive prison sentences.That is very clear. The state’s attorney has been instructed

      to prosecute such cases firmly, and if perhaps here and there

      these crimes have been treated mildly in the past, that is to

      stop immediately. The black market trading of certain irresponsible

      and unscrupulous elements who seek to make a profit from the

      war is over. We are speaking plainly, and in the interests of

      our entire people, both our soldiers at the front and those working

      at home. They all have a right in the face of the difficult conditions

      of the war to be guaranteed by the government their basic necessities.There may be certain people who are willing to pay horrendous prices 
        for rationed goods and luxuries. This is their final warning. Soon it 
        will no longer be worth the risk to take such loving care of one’s belly. 
        No one enjoys war. Neither do we want a few drones to enjoy or profit 
        from it. We all want to fight this historical battle in a clean and spotless 
        manner. When victory comes, each German man and each German woman must 
        be able to say that they have done their part. Those who do not understand 
        this, who have no conscience, who do not know what to do and not to do 
        during a war, will have to learn through other, more drastic ways.During war, all goods and foodstuffs belong to the whole nation.

      They must be distributed fairly. He who sins against this principle

      harms the community.The farmer’s crop belongs to the whole people. He should turn scavengers 
        away from his door.What German soil and labor produce passes through the hands

      of the merchant. He is the middleman. He distributes them fairly.

      Bartering will bring heavy penalties.The work of the craftsman also has its fair price. It is dishonest

      and criminal to demand or accept special benefits. The average

      person’s sense of fairness is the best guarantee of a satisfactory

      distribution. The German housewife expects and demands from the

      shopkeeper only what is her due. Paying black market prices or

      bribes is not only unworthy of her, it is criminal.Black marketeering, bribery, bartering, or excessive prices and bribery 
        will be punished.In particularly serious cases, property will be seized or

      the death penalty imposed.Everyone, whether producer, merchant or buyer is honor bound

      to act in an exemplary way. Each is satisfied with his fair share.

      That too serves the war effort and prepares for victory. It depends

      on each one of us.We cannot imagine that anyone among us would want to ignore

      our appeal to decency and fairness. He who does so takes a big

      risk. There may be an occasional person who has not taken the

      war with the proper seriousness. This was most shortsighted,

      since it endangers not only our food supplies, it also gives

      a bad example to decent citizens and threatens in the long run

      their sense of fairness and their belief in the integrity and

      decency of public life. That is far worse.In these difficult times, we all need our optimism and our deep, almost 
        holy faith. He who abuses them, who tries the patience and decency of 
        our people, deserves to be rapped on the knuckles until he learns his 
        lesson. The leadership feels more tightly bound to the people during the 
        war than ever before. We see the great sacrifices it brings for victory, 
        how patiently and bravely it accepts all that is demanded of it. We suffer 
        along with each mother who loses her son, each woman who loses her husband, 
        each child that loses its father. We know how hard farming women are working 
        in the stalls and fields. We sometimes see the dog-tired workers sitting 
        in the streetcars or subways. We listen to our soldiers on leave in Berlin 
        as they speak about their enormous sacrifices for the fatherland. We wish 
        we could sing a song each day in praise of the whole people that is so 
        brave and modest, that does its duty as it works and fights for victory 
        without making a fuss about it.We are bound to these people. They expect from the government

      that, when sacrifices are necessary, they will be shared fairly

      and equally by all. A government that failed to do this would

      no longer deserve to be called a government of the people.We all know how things stand.He who ignores the necessities of the war will pay a high

      price. The German people as a whole has behaved in an exemplary

      way, and deserves respect. We are convinced that harsh treatment

      of criminals will be greeted with enthusiasm.
