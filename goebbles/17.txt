 The film Shallow popular accounts of the great Prussian king sometimes
      make it seem as if he dealt easily with the difficulties and
      problems of warfare. In this film, however, we see a struggling
      titan with a deep heart who endured for seven years an inferno
      of sorrow, pain of every conceivable physical and spiritual nature,
      the deepest human disappointments and the hardest tests. He was
      alone, deserted, almost toothless, the wreck of a man plagued
      with gout. Then came the day when Berlin jubilantly received
      its returning king. He sat in tears in the Charlottenburg Palace
      chapel after an almost inconceivable release from the nameless
      miseries and anxieties he had faced as the thundering tones of
      Grauns’ “Te deum” resounded from the organ.It is clear that such a portrayal of the life and struggles
      of our greatest Prussian-German king is somewhat risky, even
      if it is more historically accurate and more educational for
      our day. It is more pleasant to present historical persons and
      events in a way pleasing to the average person, Nothing is easier
      to believe than that the great victories in history were the
      result of military and political superiority, that the goddess
      of war ever smiles, even to think that presenting an occasional
      danger or threat defames the reputation of historical personages.This film presents history from a different standpoint. It
      shows the human side of a true genius as a way of emphasizing
      his superhuman attributes. The greatness of this historic figures
      grows not from themselves, but rather from the weight of fate they
      bear. The physical suffering, the spiritual burdens and the temptations
      of the heart allow the character of a great man to stand out
      more vividly, they mark his outline more clearly. The film shows
      why Frederick II earned the right, uniquely, to bear the name
      “Great.” Despite the numbing blows of fate that often
      drove him to the edge of the abyss, he found the strength to
      rise triumphant above the trials and defeats. He set a shining
      example of steadfastness in misfortune to his people, his soldiers,
      his doubting generals, wavering ministers, conspiring relatives
      and protesting civil servants.This film proves the sound political and historical instincts of our
         people. It makes no compromises, presenting unadulterated historical
        truth.  It is not the usual historical romance. Despite what one might
        expect,  the broad masses have taken it as a wakeup call, making it into
        a success  with hardly a precedent in the history of German film. No
        one fails to  be moved deeply by this film. The parallels to the present,
        the words  that great king speaks, the spiritual crises that he and his
        people overcame  through battle and passion, sometimes seem so striking
        that the makers  of this film felt obliged to remark that it was planned
        not just before  Christmas for educational purposes, but rather in the
        early summer of  1940, with no idea of today’s duties and challenges.
        The contemporary  significance of the words and the resemblance of many
        events to those  of today is not the result of conscious propaganda,
        but rather of deep  historical laws.That is the truth. Each century has its historical mission.
      They do not repeat themselves, indeed are so bound to their era
      that posterity can hardly bring more than historical understanding
      for the political problems of past epochs. What remains is the
      ways in which history is made, the style and manner of expression
      that a statesman or military genius uses, the resistance that
      raises him far above his era, above all the superhuman strength
      with which he meets the challenge. How can the fact that Frederick
      defeated the Austrians be relevant to our day? His value for
      the present generation is in the worth of his personality, in
      the powerful strength of his historic genius, in his faith
      that moved mountains, in his steadfastness in misfortune, in
      the completeness with which he fulfilled his secular mission
      and in the heroic isolation with which he bore the dark shadows
      of his fate. He was the one who said that he who wants to transform
      the world cannot at the same time enjoy it.We are living in a time that is being transformed, one that
      therefore cannot be enjoyed. As perhaps never before in history,
      the fate of our people is in the hands of a single generation.
      Its desire for life, for self-assertion must decide whether we
      are at the beginning of new and unprecedented age for our people
      or whether we perhaps stand at the end of our history. Such moments
      in the rise and fall of nations always exert a powerful magic
      on brave and manly people. They see in the dangers and burdens
      a change to prove their mettle, which they know they must do
      if they are not to be weighed in the balance of fate and found
      wanting. The path to victory leads ever through the depths of
      danger and historical testing. A people must withstand many trials
      during a war. It must be armed against the tricks of a fickle
      fate that likes to subject its favorites to hard and bitter testing,
      until they finally wears the wreath of victory on their brow.A generation blessed with a great personality in such dangerous
      times is to be envied. In the course of this war people have
      found all sorts of causes that might bring victory. Some thought
      of greater economic and military resources, or a higher population,
      or a better geographical position, or the famed bravery of soldiers
      or tough civilian morale. One pitted system against system and
      world view against world view, seeking whose chances of success
      were better. We believe, however, that victory will fall to the
      side with the better leadership, as it always has. Leadership
      is crucial. If it also has the better material resources at its
      command, no power in the world can keep victory from it.We have come through a winter whose hardness and length have
      no equal in human history. It posed challenges to our leaders,
      to the front and to the homeland that we only now realize. Later
      generations of historians will write the accounts of this most
      moving chapter of the great battle. No one among us can doubt
      the almost legendary heroism German soldiers demonstrated. If
      ever our people have shown that we are not only able along with
      our allies to assume the leading role on our continent, but that
      we have a historical right to do so, it was here. The German
      people proved its merit this past winter. A nation that survives
      such a test is destined for victory.How often in these last hard weeks and months the German people
      looked in spirit to the Führer. Never has the whole nation
      felt so bound to him as in these hard times, which have spared
      no one. We felt as if we had to see him, be it only in a photograph,
      to gain the strength each needs to overcome the difficult daily
      tasks we all face. Each of us has felt obligated to him! Each
      word that he spoke to the nation was for every man woman and
      child, for every solder, worker and farmer an order! All were
      with him, without many words and without being told! The whole
      nation lived in the unspoken assurance that while we were dealing
      with our lesser or greater troubles, he was fighting his gigantic
      battle in the East. He planned until late into the night, weighing
      and risking, standing watch at his headquarters. From there his
      will flowed to the most distant part of the battlefield, filling
      even the last soldier in the most embattled unit.The power of his personality is felt nowhere more powerfully than at 
        the front. A soldier must feel led, else he cannot endure the daily risk 
        of life. When does he need that more than in those hours when he must 
        risk his life for that of the nation, far from his commander, following 
        the leading of duty and conscience. This is where the value of a great 
        and powerful personality is proven, that which as Goethe says is the highest 
        blessing among mankind. The confidence that there is one who stand above 
        all, who knows all and weighs all, who knows the sorrow and pain of his 
        people even without daily contact, who feels each individual loss that 
        touches a mother, a women, or children, yet still is able to summon the 
        strength to advance the greater national life of his people  this 
        confidence lets one endure all the sacrifices and burdens of the day more 
        easily.Nothing is harder than to accept the responsibility for the
      future of a great nation. It requires not only courage, the readiness
      to risk all, bravery of soul and steadfastness of the heart,
      but above all renunciation. From this renunciation grows the
      historical personality able to endure the lonely heights at which
      the sole duty is to serve the cause.This is how the German people saw the Führer in the past
      winter. Surrounded by his aides, politicians, and generals, surrounded
      by the love of countless millions of people, and yet in the end
      relying on himself, carrying the heavy burden of responsibility
      on his shoulders alone, fighting for the life and fate of his
      people. No matter how high we may climb, whatever the burdens
      we may carry, each of us has at least one who is still above
      him, on whom we may rely, whom we may obey, because he leads
      and orders, because he takes the heaviest weight from us when
      it grows too great for us, who fills us with new strength when
      we lose courage, begin to doubt, or tire. He reminds us of the
      great lessons of our time, of our worldview, and gives us new
      life. Whether we have the great fortune who work in his vicinity
      or even with him personally, or whether we are called to fight
      for him as unknown soldiers, workers, or farmers, we all feel
      a strength that supports and sustains us. We feel ourselves safe
      in the protection of a man who has changed our century. We need
      only follow. His task is to show the way. He stands alone, waging
      a titanic battle with fate for the life of our people.On the eve of his 53rd birthday, the whole nation gathers
      around the loudspeaker. It is far more than a festive event.
      It confirms what all Germans sense and feel, indeed more deeply
      and with greater obligation than ever before. In some sense it
      is a renewal of our loyalty and faith, proven already a million-fold through
        deeds, through uncounted sacrifices, at the risk of body and life, in
        a multitude of bitter deaths. It does not need words.If ever the German people has felt united in thought and will,
      then it is in this: to serve him and to obey his commands. The
      sounds of heroic and titanic music streaming from every German
      heart raises our confession to a solemn and holy height. When
      we finish our celebration, the voices of men and the sounds of
      instruments will join in the great conclusion to the Ninth Symphony.
      As the powerful We call the eternal power that rules over us the Almighty or God or Fate 
        or the Good Father, he who as the There is no greater good fortune on earth than to serve a
      brilliant leader, to do his work. May we do that each day. The
      difficulty of our day is also its greatness. We would change
      places with on one.In gratitude and loyalty, we send the Führer our greetings.
      An unbreakable band unites the front and the homeland. Germans
      throughout the world are united in the fervent wish that we bring
      each year on the eve of his birthday:May he remain to us what he was and is:Our Hitler!
