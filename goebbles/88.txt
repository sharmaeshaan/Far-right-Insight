 One could not understand this war if one did not always keep in mind 
        the fact that International Jewry stands behind all the unnatural forces 
        that our united enemies use to attempt to deceive the world and keep humanity 
        in the dark. It is, so to speak, the mortar that holds the enemy coalition 
        firmly together, despite its differences of class, ideology, and interests. 
        Capitalism and Bolshevism have the same Jewish roots, two branches of 
        the same tree that in the end bear the same fruit. International Jewry 
        uses both in its own way to suppress the nations and keep them in its 
        service. How deep its influence on public opinion is in all the enemy 
        countries and many neutral nations is plain to see that it may never be 
        mentioned in newspapers, speeches, and radio broadcasts. There is a law 
        in the Soviet Union that punishes anti-Semitism  or in plain English, 
        public education about the Jewish Question  by death. The expert 
        in these matters is in no way surprised that a leading spokesman for the 
        Kremlin said over the New Year that the Soviet Union would not rest until 
        this law was valid throughout the world. In other words, the enemy clearly 
        says that its goal in this war is to put the total domination of Jewry 
        over the nations of the earth under legal protection, and to threaten 
        even a discussion of this shameful attempt with the death penalty.It is little different in the plutocratic nations. There the struggle 
        against the impudent usurpation of the Jewish race is not punished by 
        the executioner, but rather by death through economic and social boycott 
        and by intellectual terror. This has the same effect in the end. Stalin, 
        Churchill, and Roosevelt were made by Jewry. They enjoy its full support 
        and reward it with their full protection. They present themselves in their 
        speeches as upright men of civil courage, yet one never hears even a word 
        against the Jews, even though there is growing hatred among their people 
        as a result of this war, a hatred that is fully justified. Jewry is a 
        taboo theme in the enemy countries. It stands outside every legal boundary 
        and thus becomes the tyrant of its host peoples. While enemy soldiers 
        fight, bleed, and die at the front, the Jews make money from their sacrifice 
        on the stock exchanges and black markets. If a brave man dares to step 
        forward and accuse the Jews of their crimes, he will be mocked and spat 
        on by their press, chased from his job or otherwise impoverished, and 
        be brought into public contempt. Even that is apparently not enough for 
        the Jews. They want to bring Soviet conditions to the whole world, giving 
        Jewry absolute power and freedom from prosecution. He who objects or even 
        debates the matter gets a bullet in the back of his head or an axe through 
        his neck. There is no worse tyranny than this. This is the epitome of 
        the public and secret disgrace that Jewry inflicts on the nations that 
        deserve freedom.That is all long behind us. Yet it still threatens us in the distance. 
        We have, it is true, entirely broken the power of the Jews in the Reich, 
        but they have not given up. They did not rest until they had mobilized 
        the whole world against us. Since they could no longer conquer Germany 
        from within, they want to try it from without. Every Russian, English, 
        and American soldier is a mercenary of this world conspiracy of a parasitic 
        race. Given the current state of the war, who could still believe that 
        they are fighting and dying at the front for the national interests of 
        their countries! The nations want a decent peace, but the Jews are against 
        it. They know that the end of the war would mean the dawning humanity’s 
        knowledge of the unhealthy role that International Jewry played in preparing 
        for and carrying out this war. They fear being unmasked, which has in 
        fact become unavoidable and must inevitably come, just as the day follows 
        the night. That explains their raging bursts of hatred against us, which 
        are only the result of their fear and their feelings of inferiority. They 
        are too eager, and that makes them suspicious. International Jewry will 
        not succeed in turning this war to its advantage. Things are already too 
        far along. The hour will come in which all the peoples of the earth will 
        awake, and the Jews will be the victims. Here, too, things can only go 
        so far.It is an old, often-used method of International Jewry to discredit education 
        and knowledge about its corrupting nature and drives, thereby depending 
        on the weaknesses of those people who easily confuse cause with effect. 
        The Jews are also masters at manipulating public opinion, which they dominate 
        through their network of news agencies and press concerns that reaches 
        throughout the world. The pitiful illusion of a free press is one of the 
        methods they use to stupefy the publics of enemy lands. If the enemy press 
        is as free as it pretends to be, let it take an open position, for or 
        against, on the Jewish Question. It will not do that because it cannot 
        and may not do so. The Jews love to mock and criticize everything except 
        themselves, although everyone knows that they are most in need of public 
        criticism. This is where the so-called freedom of the press in enemy countries 
        ends. Newspapers, parliaments, statesmen, and church leaders must be silent 
        here. Crimes and vices, filth and corruption are covered by the blanket 
        of love. The Jews have total control of public opinion in enemy countries, 
        and he who has that is also master of all of public life. Only the nations 
        that have to accept such a condition are to be pitied. The Jews mislead 
        them into believing that the German nation is backward. Our alleged backwardness 
        is actually proof of our progress. We have recognized the Jews as a national 
        and international danger, and from this knowledge have drawn compelling 
        conclusions. This German knowledge will become the knowledge of the world 
        at the end of this war. We think it our primary duty to do everything 
        in our power to make that happen.Humanity would sink into eternal darkness, it would fall into a dull 
        and primitive state, were the Jews to win this war. They are the incarnation 
        of that destructive force that in these terrible years has guided the 
        enemy war leadership in a fight against all that we see as noble, beautiful, 
        and worth keeping. For that reason alone the Jews hate us. They despise 
        our culture and learning, which they perceive as towering over their nomadic 
        worldview. They fear our economic and social standards, which leave no 
        room for their parasitic drives. They are the enemy of our domestic order, 
        which has excluded their anarchistic tendencies. Germany is the first 
        nation in the world that is entirely free of the Jews. That is the prime 
        cause of its political and economic balance. Since their expulsion from 
        the German national body has made it impossible for them to shake this 
        balance from within, they lead the nations they have deceived in battle 
        against us from without. It is fine with them, in fact it is part of their 
        plan, that Europe in the process will lose a large part of its cultural 
        values. The Jews had no part in their creation. They do not understand 
        them. A deep racial instinct tells them that since these heights of human 
        creative activity are forever beyond their reach, they must attack them 
        today with hatred. The day is not distant when the nations of Europe, 
        yes, even those of the whole world, will shout: The Jews are guilty for 
        all our misfortunes! They must be called to account, and soon and thoroughly!International Jewry is ready with its alibi. Just as during the great 
        reckoning in Germany, they will attempt to look innocent and say that 
        one needs a scapegoat, and they are it. But that will no longer help them, 
        just as it did not help them during the National Socialist revolution, 
        The proof of their historical guilt, in details large and small, is so 
        plain that it can no longer be denied even with the most clever lies and 
        hypocrisy.Who is it that drives the Russians, the English, and the Americans into 
        battle and sacrifices huge numbers of human lives in a hopeless struggle 
        against the German people? The Jews! Their newspapers and radio broadcasts 
        spread the songs of war while the nations they have deceived are led to 
        the slaughter. Who is it that invents new plans of hatred and destruction 
        against us every day, making this war into a dreadful case of self-mutilation 
        and self-destruction of European life and its economy, education and culture? 
        The Jews! Who devised the unnatural marriage between England and the USA 
        on one side and Bolshevism on the other, building it up and jealously 
        ensuring its continuance? Who covers the most perverse political situations 
        with cynical hypocrisy from a trembling fear that a new way could lead 
        the nations to realize the true causes of this terrible human catastrophe? 
        The Jews, only the Jews! They are named Morgenthau and Lehmann and stand 
        behind Roosevelt as a so-called brain trust. They are named Mechett and 
        Sasoon and serve as Churchill’s moneybags and order givers. They are named 
        Kaganovitsch and Ehrenburg and are Stalin’s pacesetters and intellectual 
        spokesmen. Wherever you look, you see Jews. They march as political commissars 
        behind the Red army and organize murder and terror in the areas conquered 
        by the Soviets. They sit behind the lines in Paris and Brussels, Rome 
        and Athens, and fashion their reins from the skin of the unhappy nations 
        that have fallen under their power.That is the truth. It can no longer be denied, particularly since in 
        their drunken joy of power and victory the Jews have forgotten their ordinarily 
        so carefully maintained reserve and now stand in the spotlight of public 
        opinion. They no longer bother, apparently believing that it is no longer 
        necessary, that their hour has come. And this is their mistake, which 
        they always make when think themselves near their great goal of anonymous 
        world domination. Throughout the history of the nations, whenever this 
        tragic situation developed, a good providence saw to it that the Jews 
        themselves became the gravediggers of their own hopes. They did not destroy 
        the healthy peoples, but rather the sting of their parasitic effects brought 
        the realization of the looming danger to the forefront and led to the 
        greatest sacrifices to overcome it. At a certain point, they become that 
        power that always wants evil but creates good. It will be that way this 
        time, too.The fact that the German nation was the first on earth to recognize this 
        danger and expel it from its organism is proof of its healthy instincts. 
        It therefore became the leader of a world struggle whose results will 
        determine the fate and the future of International Jewry. We view with 
        complete calm the wild Old Testament tirades of hatred and revenge of 
        Jews throughout the world against us. They are only proof that we are 
        on the right path. They cannot unsettle us. We gaze on them with sovereign 
        contempt and remember that these outbursts of hate and revenge were everyday 
        events for us in Germany until that fateful day for International Jewry, 
        30 January 1933, when the world revolution against the Jews that threatened 
        them not only Germany, but all the other nations, began.It will not cease before it has reached its goal. The truth cannot be 
        stopped by lies or force. It will get through. The Jews will meet their 
        Cannae at the end of this war. Not Europe, but rather they will lose. They 
        may laugh at this prophecy today, but they have laughed so often in the 
        past, and almost as often they stopped laughing sooner or later. Not only 
        do we know precisely what we want, we also know precisely what we do not 
        want. The deceived nations of the Earth may still lack the knowledge they 
        need, but we will bring it to them. How will the Jews stop that in the 
        long run? They believe their power rests on sure foundations, but it stands 
        on feet of clay. One hard blow and it will collapse, burying the creators 
        of the misfortunes of the world in its ruins.
