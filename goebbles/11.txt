 My German comrades!Tomorrow, Monday, the Führer celebrates his 47th birthday.As in previous years since the takeover of power, I take the opportunity 
        on this festive occasion to speak to the whole German nation. On this 
        day, our people thinks with rare unanimity and unique determination about 
        the man who has become the personification of Germany�s resurrection for 
        all Germans, whether in the Reich or throughout the world, and who is 
        the symbol of a strong and revitalized Reich.Tomorrow morning, this whole people wishes to proclaim its love and honor 
        to the Führer, but also its thankfulness for his impact on humanity 
        and on history. Among them are those countless millions who cast their 
        votes for him on 29 March of this year, and thus ceremonially affirmed 
        that they saw him as the embodiment of faith in our national future, and 
        of the security and honor of the Reich. Never before in history has one 
        man so embodied the confidence and feeling of togetherness of a whole 
        people. I am happy that tonight I am the interpreter of all these feelings.We are still in the midst of the Führer�s constructive work. Each 
        of us has enough troubles and challenges to face, and there are countless 
        tasks that confront us. And, of course, Adolf Hitler has not resolved 
        all the tensions and differences, all the misunderstandings and frictions 
        within the German people. But on this we can all agree: that Germany�s 
        leadership is in the best, most loyal and most dependable hands of Adolf 
        Hitler, and that in him, in his person, and in his human and political 
        impact, there is the assurance that these remaining problems will in good 
        time find an appropriate organic solution. Like a rock in the ocean, he 
        stands firm against all the troubles and difficulties of everyday life, 
        the peaceful place in the flood of events.The impact of his historic acts are already so deeply driven into the 
        heart and soul of the whole German people that it seems entirely unnecessary 
        to waste even a word about them. And that is not the reason that I wish 
        to speak this evening about his birthday tomorrow. I want to speak personally 
        about him. The whole world knows him as a statesman and Führer: Few 
        have the privilege of seeing him close up as a person and to sense daily 
        his personal force.Millions of Germans were deeply moved by the gripping words of his speech 
        on the election of 29 March of this year. They heard him say that he had 
        given the German people strength for three years, and that now the German 
        people must give him strength. He had often strengthened the nation�s 
        faith; now the nation had to strengthen his faith. Over the past three years, those of us who are close to him have often 
        seen how necessary strength and faith are to his work. No day or night, 
        no hour, passed that did not bring for him a mass of work and challenges. 
        It is often the case that a people comes to take the successes of its 
        policies in a matter-of-fact way, that it gradually gets used to them. 
      It has no idea of the effort, of the courage, of the responsibility that 
        are necessary to make those successes possible. Most people only become 
        aware of that when dangers surface alongside the successes, the dangers 
        that a far-sighted statesman has always seen and taken into account, which 
        he has struggled with alone during long, sleepless nights. As great as 
        the miracle of Germany�s rebirth seems to us, greater still is the miracle 
        of how one man, in a time when complete hopelessness had seized the widest 
        circles of his people, found the courage and the strong and unshakeable 
        heart that were needed. It is not easy to lift a people up from the ground; 
        it takes not only intelligence, but also daring. Over these three years, the Führer has had the courage to face a 
        Europe that was in danger of collapse because of its senile dishonesty, 
        giving it the truth that was at first bitter and painful, but which in 
        the end restored its honor. He gave a sterile system new movement. He 
        became in foreign policy what he had long been in domestic policy: a great 
        simplifier who took the most complicated and intricate problems that Europe 
        was incapable of solving and found natural and understandable approaches.The peace plan that he recently presented to the world is a masterpiece 
        of constructive and simplifying work. It is European in the broadest and 
        most modern sense. Future historians will undoubtedly see it as a deep 
        and liberating breath on the part of the world that was trapped in its 
        contradictions, and had become lifeless.All of this assures the Führer of the confidence and blind allegiance 
        of the broad masses of our people. The love that they bring him is directed 
        above all to his person, to his deep and powerful humanity, that comes 
        to expression in all of his words and deeds. On the afternoon of 29 March 
        the first surprising election results came over the wires, reaching the 
        whole world through the ether and giving powerful expression to the German 
        miracle. There was hardly a politically aware person not only in Germany, 
        but throughout the world, who did not think of the man who was the creator 
        and builder of this miracle. He was at his home in Berlin with a group 
        of young girls from the BDMBefore him, the German people was really never a world people in the 
        real sense of the word. He gave them the will for that. The calm dignity 
        he shows in representing the Reich is a model for the entire nation. The 
        simplicity of his character is bound to the monumentality of his historic 
        impact, displaying generosity in matters and things that deserve it, paired 
        with determination toward things and people that require it. He is not 
        only called the Führer, he is the Führer. His relationship to children never ceases to move and amaze us. They 
        approach him with complete trust, and he meets them with the same trust. 
        Children must have the natural ability to know that he belongs to them 
        with heart and soul. Perhaps they realize dimly that he alone is to be 
        thanked for the fact that for German children, a German life has once 
        again become worth living.When the Führer made his last appeal to the German people from Cologne 
        on 28 March, the eve of the great day of German affirmation, the whole 
        nation was deeply moved. One had the sense that all of Germany, every 
        class, occupation and religious confession, had become one great, all-encompassing 
        house of God, a place where their advocate approached the throne of the 
        Almighty to bear witness of their will and deeds, and to ask his grace 
        and protection for a future that was still uncertain and unclear to us. 
        It was a call to fate, one never heard before in the German language with 
        such monumentality. In Cologne, we saw hard and strong men who had faced 
        many a danger break out in tears at the Führer�s final words. It 
        seemed to us that heaven could not fail to hear the cry of a people for 
        freedom and peace. Afterwards, we took a short, deserted route to the railway station and 
        sat in a dark compartment of the almost silent train, watching silently 
        as we passed the cities and villages of this productive German province. 
        In the distance we could see the chimneys and furnaces of the Ruhr. Thousands 
        and thousand of lights glittered across the fields. Beneath us, hammers 
        thundered, machines sang, drills rattled and sirens wailed. It was the 
        song of labor that even now did not slumber. Masses of people were gathered 
        at the stations where we made brief stops. They were probably following 
        a mysterious, silent inner force, waving and cheering once again to the 
        man whose voice had called them. But he sat silently at the window of 
        his compartment and traveled through his land, through his people, and 
        probably had the happy feeling of resting deeply and comfortably in the 
        heart of his nation.And the next day, this heart broke forth. People went to the voting booths 
        with firm and confident step, to the north and south, the east and west, 
        young and old, high and low, and helped him to build the unshakable foundation 
        he needed to speak to the world in the name of this whole people in defense 
        of its national right to life. Where else on this broad planet is there 
        a statesman as firm and confident as he?Tomorrow, from wherever Germans dwell, their best wishes will rise to 
        him. May a gracious fate keep him healthy and strong, and grant him a 
        blessed hand. And may he be with us for a long, long time, for if he is 
        with us, all is well.He is for us what was for us, and he will remain for us what he is for 
        us:
