 Good treatments of the development of the Hitler myth are
      provided by On 3 September last year, two hours after English plutocracy declared 
        war on the German Reich, the British Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a 
        radio speech to the German people in the most broken German. One might 
        call it the first English act of war, and it proved to be the first, worst, 
        and most fateful psychological error that the British plutocracy could 
        make. Chamberlain did not betray who had given him the right to speak 
        to the German nation. He was of the opinion that the German people he 
        was attempting to speak to was in about the same intellectual and spiritual 
        condition as it was after the capitulation of 9 November 1918, when it 
        gave itself up to the arbitrary lust for revenge of the Western powers. 
        The point of the speech was that England had no intention of waging war 
        against the German people, but rather intended to help them. Germany needed 
        only to accept the simple British proposal to get rid of the Führer 
        or so-called Hitlerism, and the result would be a quick and easy peace. 
        We can remark in passing that during the seven months of the war, British 
        plutocracy had long since stopped telling the world such hypocritical 
        platitudes. Its best and most eloquent publicists have long since made 
        it clear that the goal of British plutocracy is to destroy the German 
        people and the German Reich. They wish to return it to its state after 
        the Peace of Westphalia in the year 1648.At the beginning of the war, however, they sang the same old
      song. It was a bit too familiar to our ears to be effective.
      Its melody was dull and worn out. British plutocracy had tried
      to persuade the Boers during the South African war of the same
      thing. Britain was only fighting Krugerism. As is well known,
      that did not stop them from allowing countless thousands of women
      and children to starve in English concentration camps. During
      the World War as well, England was supposedly fighting only against
      the Kaiser, not the German people. Yet after we fell for the
      British swindle, we were forced at Versailles in 1919 to accept
      the most disgraceful and humiliating peace treaty of modern history.But that is aside from the point. If the German people took
      any notice at all of the whining remarks of the English prime
      minister, it observed the lying tone even in the first days of
      the war. It took only a psychological interest in the speech.
      Mr. Chamberlain probably did not realize that the German people
      were fully aware that their struggle for existence had begun,
      and that they would think it infamous and entirely foolish for
      the head British plutocrat, of all people, to attempt to persuade
      them to give up their sharpest and best defensive weapon, namely
      the relationship between the Führer and the nation. It was
      really the most stupid thing that London could have done at that
      critical time. In his encouragement to separate from the Führer,
      Chamberlain hit the most sensitive part of the German people’s
      soul. One might just as well try to persuade a believing and
      trusting child that he should leave his parents in the lurch
      at a moment of danger.It is really more proof of the unlimited stubbornness with
      which the leading and governing English plutocratic class likes
      to see the world outside England. It has not the least idea of
      the transformation the German people has undergone since 1918,
      and particularly in the last seven years. It may be that in more
      peaceful times our people have debated minor and trivial issues
      heatedly, even fought about them. One likes something, the next
      one does not. We Germans obviously come from the most varied
      political camps. We adult Germans were around before National
      Socialism. We had rather vague political positions and worldviews.
      Countless Germans were then members of other parties and adherents
      of other worldviews. It is even possible that some of us still
      have remnants of former views. That may be true, and is not all
      that bad. We Germans do all agree on one thing, though: There
      is nothing that can separate us from the love, obedience and
      confidence we have in and for the Führer. We all know that
      that is the strongest weapon that the German nation has in its
      battle for existence.For the first time in German history, the political instinct
      of our people finds its expression and fulfillment in a leading
      personality. That is why the connection we feel to the Führer
      is to deeply rooted, and why particularly in challenging times
      this relationship of confidence between Führer and people
      reaches a degree that is incomprehensible to the so-called democratic
      peoples.We face a hard test today. Modern war is fought not only with
      weapons. We see in the recent past a growing comprehensiveness
      to military thinking. War today is waged on all fronts, on the
      economic front and above all on the front of the struggle for
      the souls of nations. This war is a gigantic struggle that affects
      every area of popular life. It is not unknown to us that the
      British plutocratic class has won its past victories by destroying
      the spiritual foundations of its enemies, using selfish and dirty
      means to advance its own interests.That is why London has always been particularly active in
      the battle for the popular soul. It does not cost much, and saves
      a lot of blood and money. Until the arrival of National Socialism,
      the German people were particularly susceptible in this regard.
      That explains why we first failed spiritually on 9 November 1918,
      collapsing only after that in all other areas. The Führer’s
      educational work has made the German people forever immune to
      such attempts in the future. Plutocratic England is whistling
      in the wind when it even attempts to speak to the German people,
      which explains why it increasingly is giving up the numbing and
      seductive phrases it tried during the first weeks of the war.
      The German people simply laughs at them. It will accept neither
      orders nor advice or even good cheer from London. The whole flood
      of lies that London has unleashed against the Reich vanishes
      without having any effect at all.Instead, the German people see in the Führer the incarnation
      of its national strength and a shining example of its national
      goals. He is a people’s leader in the truest sense of the word.
      We recall a scene from a newsreel from the first weeks of the
      Polish campaign. The Führer and his generals are gathered
      around a map in a conference room. Ideas are weighed and plans
      forced. Anyone can see immediately that serious military problems
      are being discussed. The camera moves slowly away from the generals
      and focuses on the Führer, off to one side. The eye is struck
      by the man to whom we all look, his face worn with cares, weighed
      down by his thoughts, an historical personality, great and alone.
      We saw this scene from the Polish campaign much later at the
      premiere of the Luftwaffe film “Baptism of Fire” in
      a large Berlin theater. One generally does not credit the Berliners
      with much respect for their leaders, but as the Führer’s
      face appeared on the screen, a deep, quiet, silent movement spread
      through the packed theater. No one said a word, but all felt
      the same. Millions of people have seen the picture since then,
      and still this picture has a deep impression on viewers, as countless
      letters and messages tell us.During the Polish campaign, people quickly browsed through
      the columns covering the huge battle of annihilation against
      the Polish army, then looked for information about where the
      Führer was, how he was feeling, what he was doing. Seldom
      has a people been so interested in the life and thoughts and
      wishes of a man. That is entirely natural, indeed it could not
      be otherwise. Every German instinctively senses the seriousness
      and dangers of the hour. His word, even his wish, is for we Germans
      an order.How could an English merchant’s soul understand that? Mr.
      Chamberlain recently said at an opulent breakfast held in his
      honor by the City of London that the polite applause he received
      was not the result of orders, as was the fashion in Germany.
      We could only laugh. How little the present British prime minister
      understands the German people that he has in a careless moment
      unscrupulously compelled to fight for its existence, and how
      this people will disappoint him and the British plutocratic class
      that stands behind him! He is leading an old and sinking world
      against a young and modern people, a people that since 1918 has
      survived a terrible lesson and has finally found itself. It is
      deeply conscious of its good fortune in having found in National
      Socialism the realization of its political faith and in the Führer
      the embodiment of its desire for a leading personality.We are living in a great and decisive age. The German nation is gathering 
        its whole strength together to defend its national life. The front and 
        the homeland form a closed unity in common brotherhood, knowing that the 
        fate of the German people is at stake. That is why, as foreign observers 
        and reporters constantly note with astonishment, all Germans are filled 
        with a calm, almost sovereign confidence. Today, we are fighting and working, 
        that is all. No one complains and no one asks why. Our people certainly 
        as war-related burdens and difficulties to deal with. All wait nonetheless 
        for the Führer’s order. When he calls, all are there.We want to trust him and follow him! That is what the German
      people say today. This resolve gives us as a people and a nation
      enormous power, which other countries call the German miracle.
      It is a riddle to the world, but obvious to us! We can hardly
      imagine how things once were or how they could be any different.Tomorrow we celebrate the 51st birthday of the man who brought this miracle 
        about. We will not do so in loud and noisy parties, but rather as a people 
        in the midst of battle and work. In the past, in Berlin above all, we 
        gathered along the sidewalks of the east-west avenue to watch his soldiers 
        march past, and greeted him with storms of heils. This time there will 
        be no parade, no uproar. Yet the love that binds us to him and the confidence 
        we gave him is even more passionate, even deeper.Tomorrow he may see in spirit a great parade of our people march past, 
        both from the Front and the homeland  soldiers, farmers, and workers 
         all, all those who are filled with his spirit and who are defending 
        Germany’s life.One wish fills the entire nation, whether at the front or
      at home, be they German soldiers in Norway and Denmark or the
      men of our U-boats and warships, or the soldiers up against the
      Western Front or the millions in the bunkers and interior positions,
      or the dead-tired flyer high in the heavens, or the farmer plowing
      his field, or the worker at the roaring machine, or the thinkers
      of the mind and spirit, or above all the millions of German mothers
      and their children:The entire people has one thought: Long live the Führer!May he lead us as he always has though grave and difficult
      times to a shining German victory. May he remain what he is to
      us and always was:
