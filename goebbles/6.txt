 One of the most significant years in German history ends today. Not only 
        the Reich, but Europe as a whole changed greatly during its course. States, 
        nations, and peoples have been transformed, and changes in the balance 
        of power occurred that one would not have thought possible over decades, 
        much less one short year. People would have thought me a fool and a dreamer, 
        certainly not a politician to be taken seriously, had I prophesied in 
        my New Year address last year that we would now have a front reaching 
        from Kirkenes to Biskaya, that German soldiers would be standing watch 
        along this 5000 kilometer long front, that Norway would be under German 
        protection up to the Arctic Circle, that France would be militarily destroyed, 
        that England would be suffering under the German counter blockade, that 
        it would be receiving attacks by day and night on its centers as revenge 
        from the German Luftwaffe, that it would be reeling from the blows of 
        our army and struggling for its very existence, and that London would 
        be begging for help from the rest of the world to survive even a few months 
        longer. I would have been asked: “How are you even going to get to 
        Kirkenes? Where are the ships you will need? And France has tough and 
        brave soldiers. Its army is well-equipped and armed. It is rich, it has 
        much support, and do not forget the Maginot Line! We have painful memories 
        of the World War, in which we fought for weeks to gain a half a kilometer 
        of land and soaked the French soil with streams of German blood.” 
        I would have heard all that and more.Today such comments are long forgotten. We hardly remember

      them. We can hardly recall that they were once made seriously.

      Time passes quickly, and we have all gotten used to accepting

      our unprecedented successes and historic victories.Being a prophet is a thankless task. Things always exceed

      what we prophesy. Things are on the move, transforming the prejudices,

      obscurities, and complexities of the past with a hard, but orderly

      hand. How can we even begin to say what tomorrow will bring when

      we can hardly understand what is happening today!It is however an important principle of clear political judgment

      that one must be able to understand the future in terms of the

      past. One must not cling to yesterday, but think about tomorrow,

      to research, but also to act. Only respect for the past gives

      one the strength to recognize what is coming. The bourgeois is

      afraid of action, but is impressed by past successes and victories.

      He easily forgets the battles that have been won and the things

      that have been accomplished, since he generally had little to

      do with planning and executing them. Before something happens

      he cannot have too much fear, afterwards he has all the courage

      he needs.As we reviewed 1939 a year ago, the first four months of this gigantic 
        war were over. We could look back on big, proud, and unprecedented victories 
        by the German army. Poland was no more. The German army stood on the border 
        of the present General Gouvernment. The threat to the Reich from the east 
        was over, and worries about a two-front war were a matter of the past.Still, the central question of the military situation remained

      unresolved. With uncertain expectation the people heard the rumblings

      of distant thunder. The West was armed, and its dark and threatening

      speeches rolled over the Reich. If one had believed French statesmen

      at the time, it was only a matter of weeks before the Reich fell

      apart. A Paris newspaper wrote that we would be standing in lines

      outside French field kitchens.Are Mr. Churchill and his satellites speaking any differently

      today? In their wild desperation and helplessness they are using

      the same silly language to conceal their fear of coming events.

      They are grasping at straws that will fail as soon as they are

      really believed.Our opponents have always talked more than we do. Before something happens 
        they talk a lot, only to grow suddenly silent when it actually happens. 
        When things did not seem to be happening, they made the grandest threats 
        against us. It has always been their fate to make the same mistake our 
        enemies did during our struggle for power  they failed to take the 
        Führer seriously. They ignored his warnings and when he was silent 
        concluded that he did not know what to say or do. Three weeks before Hitler 
        became chancellor, the then chancellor said that Hitler’s day was over. 
        Schuschnigg railed against the Reich two hours before he was driven in 
        shame from the chancellor’s palace in Vienna. Benesch had already packed 
        his bags when he maintained that he had a plan to deal with the apparently 
        hopeless situation. Polish statesmen dreamed of a victory at the gates 
        of Berlin as German guns were already shelling Warsaw. Two months before 
        France’s collapse Monsieur Reynaud innocently showed diplomats a map of 
        how Germany would be divided into separate parts. Is Mr. Churchill doing 
        any different today? In his speeches and in the newspapers he explains 
        the peace conditions for Germany once the war is over, while the British 
        Isles in fact are bleeding heavily and gasping for breath. From our beginnings 
        to the present, National Socialism’s enemies seem determined to prove 
        the accuracy of the old proverb: “The Lord makes blind those whom 
        he wishes to punish.”Might I ask what Monsieur Reynaud would have done a year ago had he known 
        what 1940 would bring France, or what Mr. Churchill would do now if he 
        knew England’s fate in 1941? We National Socialists seldom make prophecies, 
        but we never make false ones. Had one believed the Führer back then, 
        the world would have been spared much misery. Things probably had to happen 
        as they did, however, since a new order of the coming proportions can 
        be born only with pain, and the historic sins of the western democracies 
        must find their historic recompense.Whatever they may want, the new Germany is the instrument

      of fate. At the front and at home we have a community of 90 million,

      ready for any danger or threat. We have the good fortune to have

      a Führer who has led us down a straight path from the earliest

      beginnings onward. He can depend on his soldiers, workers, farmers,

      officials, and professionals. They understand him as he understands

      them. During the hard months of the war we have had but one thought:

      victory. We will work and fight for it until the last foe is

      conquered.In these last hours of the old year we recall with thanks

      the great victories given us by fate, and celebrate them before

      the world. We will never flag nor fail. We bring the sacrifices

      the war requires with good cheer. No power in the world will

      make us deny our duty, or forget even for a moment our historic

      task of maintaining the freedom of our people.I greet the entire German people at the end of this great

      and eventful year. I greet the men at home whose hard work supports

      the war, the workers at the wharves and munitions factories.

      I greet the women who accept all the difficulties and challenges

      the war brings, who have jumped in everywhere to replace the men

      who have gone to the front, who in the midst of it all still

      give birth. I greet the children, the countless German children

      who are touched by the hard facts of war, who often have left

      their parents’ homes in regions threatened by air attacks. I

      greet our workers, our farmers, our professionals, who together

      are a people who have proven worthy of the time in which we live.Are warmest and most grateful greetings go to our soldiers.

      I express the wishes and greetings of the homeland. From the

      depths of our heart to think of our brave army, our glorious

      Luftwaffe, and our victorious German navy.The homeland and the front form a big family as we bid farewell to a 
        year that was full of challenges, but also of big historic victories. The 
        German people bows in praise before the Almighty, who has so clearly blessed 
        us in the past year by standing by us in battle and crowning our weapons 
        with victory. He knows that we are waging this war for a better peace, 
        that we are fighting for the happiness of people who have so often been 
        oppressed by their governments.The entire German nation, at home and at the front, joins in a warm
        thanks  to the Führer. 90 million glowing hearts greet him. It is
        with him  both in good times and bad, just as it knows that the Führer
        is always  with his people. We Germans wish him happiness and blessing
        for the new  year, a strong, firm and sure hand, health and strength
        in all his efforts.  Long may he live, long may he protect the people
        as the first fighter  for a true and real peace and for the happiness,
        honor, and fame of his  people. The world admires him, but we may love
        him. We all extend our  hands to him and hold firmly and inseparably
        to him.The old year is over. A new one comes. May it be no less full of happiness, 
        blessing, and proud victory than the last!
