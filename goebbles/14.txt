 In an unsettled and confused world, Germany tomorrow celebrates a national 
        holiday in the truest sense of the word. It is a holiday for the entire 
        nation. The German people celebrate the day entirely as a matter of the 
        heart, not of the understanding.Tomorrow the Führer finishes his fiftieth year. The entire German 
        nation takes pride in this day, a pride in which those peoples who are 
        friendly with us also take deep and hearty part. Even those who are neutral 
        or oppose us cannot ignore the strong impact of the events. Adolf Hitler’s 
        name is a political program for the entire world. He is almost a legend. 
        His name is a dividing line. No one on earth can remain indifferent to 
        his name. For some, he represents hope, faith, and the future, for others 
        he is an exemplar of confused hatred, base lies, and cowardly slander.The highest that a person can achieve is to give his name to an historical 
        era, to stamp his personality indelibly on his age. Certainly the Führer 
        has done that. One cannot imagine today’s world without him.Treitschke once said that men make history. If this is true, when more 
        so than in our era? He has shown his simplicity and depth in the most 
        wonderful way. Adolf Hitler has influenced not only the historical development 
        of his country, but one can say without fear of exaggeration that he has 
        given all of European history a new direction, that he is the towering 
        guarantee of a new order for Europe.Our part of the world looks vastly different today that it would without 
        him, not to mention his impact on our own people and nation. He has given 
        the German nation an entirely new face through revolutionary internal 
        transformations.Someone who saw Germany for the last time in 1918 would scarcely recognize 
        it today. The people and nation are entirely different. What seemed like 
        a miracle only a short while ago is self-evident today.About a year ago the Führer solved the problem of joining Austria 
        to the Reich. The whole people celebrated his 49th birthday then. 7 1/2 
        million Germans had returned to the Reich. A Central European problem 
        one almost believed to be unsolvable was miraculously solved.On the eve of his 50th birthday, we can happily see that once again the 
        map of Europe has changed in the Reich’s favor, and  unique in world 
        history  this change has occurred without bloodshed. It came as 
        the result of a clear desire to establish peace in an area of Europe in 
        which the contradictions were so severe that there was danger that they 
        sooner or later would cause a general European conflagration.This new peace in the threatened areas is not a peace of tired, moralistic 
        theories that are endangered as often as the false bourgeois democrats 
        praise them. It is much more a peace that is built on practical realitiesSuch a peace could be built only on the foundations of a higher, instinctive 
        understanding growing from the knowledge that only strength gives a people 
        the opportunity to finally resolve problems.Successful policies require both imagination and reality. Imagination 
        as such is constructive. It alone provides the strength for powerful, 
        flexible historical conceptions. Realism on the other hands brings the 
        ideas of political fantasy in agreement with hard reality.The Führer possesses both characteristics in a unique harmony seldom 
        seen in history. Imagination and reality join in him to determine the 
        goals and methods of political policy. His contemporaries are constantly 
        astonished and amazed by seeing how he brilliantly brings goals and methods 
        together to influence history. He has no stubborn ideas, no tired tactical 
        doctrines, to dim his vision and reduce his political imagination. His 
        inflexible principles are joined with changing and flexible political 
        methods that have lead to the greatest and most unexpected successes for 
        Germany.That is nothing new for us old National Socialists. We learned to admire 
        the Führer’s political abilities in the earliest phases of our party’s 
        hard struggle for power in the Reich. They were demonstrated in many small 
        and apparently unimportant ways at the time, though they were then for 
        us and the movement as important as the goals and problems of today.Then too there were doubters who failed to see the greatness and brilliance 
        of the Führer’s decisions during the struggle for power. They favored 
        the false wisdom that Clausewitz discussed: they wanted nothing but to 
        escape danger. We are therefore not surprised or anxious to see the same 
        or similar happenings in internal German politics that we earlier saw 
        in the National Socialist movement.The only thing that has changed over the years is the scale of the Führer’s 
        actions; his methods and goals have remained the same. Back then we saw 
        in him the political instincts of a truly historic genius, able to understand 
        problems and find the simplest and clearest solution to them from his 
        own greatness and certainty. That is why we were then his most loyal and 
        obedient servants of this man and his work, entirely aside from the human 
        element.So what we see today is nothing new for us old National Socialists. We 
        therefore have no doubt of the outcome of Germany’s current battle for 
        its national existence. Our whole people has the same instinctive feelings, 
        which are the cause of the blind and unshakable confidence it places in 
        the Führer.The man in the street is usually not in a position to understand the 
        entire political situation. He lacks the practice, the experience and 
        above all the background necessary to form a clear and certain judgment. 
        It is therefore entirely understandable why he dislikes theories and programs, 
        and prefers to place his firm and confident faith in a personality.A nation inclines to doctrines only when it is poor in personalities. 
        But when a man of historic greatness stands at its head, one who not only 
        wants to lead but is able to do so, the people will follow him with its 
        whole heart, giving him its willing and obedient allegiance. Even more, 
        it will put all of its love and their blind confidence behind him and 
        his work.A nation is willing to sacrifice when it knows what it is sacrificing 
        for and why it is necessary. That is true in Germany today. None of the 
        numerous slogans that the broad masses of our people heard in the years 
        after 1918 has had such powerful effect on the entire nation as the phrase 
        “One People, one Reich, one Führer!”The first two phrases were heard for the first time in 1937 at a singing 
        festival in Breslau. The Führer stood high on the platform against 
        the gathering darkness. Hundreds of thousands of people had gathered from 
        every corner of the nation and from everywhere in Europe where Germans 
        dwell to hear him speak. Suddenly, from the corner of this army of hundreds 
        of thousands where the Austrians stood came the call “One people, 
        one Reich.” It gripped and fascinated the whole crowd, and for the 
        first time gave concise but clear expression to a program.A year later we saw the Führer on a hot Sunday afternoon standing 
        on the platform at the Schloßplatz in Breslau once again. German 
        gymnasts performed before him. As the racial comrades from the Sudetenland 
        passed before him, without command or order, they suddenly formed a wall 
        before him. These people who had come from the Sudetenland to Breslau 
        only to see his face, refused to move. Weeping women seized his hand. 
        One could not understand what they were trying to say, since tears drowned 
        their voices.Once again, it was only a few months before the problem they had brought 
        to the Führer was solved.The Greater German Reich, in the truest sense of the word, has now become 
        a reality. Even more, the Führer has given his peace to Central Europe. 
        It is clear that this is not to the pleasure of those democratic enviers 
        of the National Socialist Reich. Through the Treaty of Versailles they 
        had build a ring of trouble spots around Germany that they could use to 
        keep the Reich in constant difficulties.A man has come from the broad masses of the German people who removed 
        these trouble spots with the firmest measures. Democracy sees its hopes 
        vanishing. That explains their rage and moralistic disappointments. Their 
        hypocritical prayers came too late. The enemies of the Reich are at the 
        end of their rope. They look ridiculous, and cannot understand why.We greet their hysterical cries with sovereign contempt, a sovereign 
        contempt shared by the entire German people. The German people know that 
        the Führer has restored it to its rightful position in the world. 
        The Reich stands in the shadow of the German sword. Germany’s economy, 
        culture and popular life are blooming under a security guaranteed by the 
        army. The nation, once sunk into impotence, has risen to new greatness.We remember all of this as we begin to celebrate the 50th birthday of 
        the man whom we thank for our nation’s might and our people’s greatness. 
        No German at home or anywhere else in the world can fail to take the deepest 
        and heartiest pleasure in participation. It is a holiday of the nation, 
        and we want to celebrate it as such.A people fighting for its fate must now and again stop in the midst of 
        the tumult of events to remind itself of its situation, methods and goals. 
        Today is such a time. The nation puts on its best clothing and stands 
        before its Führer united in loyalty and brotherhood, to bring him 
        their heartiest best wishes on his 50th birthday. These are the wishes 
        of all Germans in the Reich, as well as those in every other nation and 
        continent. Germans throughout the world join with us who have the good 
        fortune to live in the Reich in these warm and thankful wishes. To this 
        choir of a hundred million are joined the voices of all those peoples 
        want true peace and order in Europe, who love its history and its culture.As we begin to celebrate the Führer’s 50th birthday in this festive 
        hour as a great national community, we join in a fervent prayer to Almighty 
        God that he graciously preserve in the future his life and work. May he 
        grant the German people’s deepest wish and keep the Führer in health 
        and strength for many more years and decades. Then we will not need to 
        fear for the future of the Reich. The fate of the German nation rests 
        in a strong and sure hand.We, the Führer’s oldest followers and fellow fighters join together 
        at this festive hour with the hearty wish that we have always had on the 
        birthday of this man: May he remain for us what he is and always was:Our Hitler!
