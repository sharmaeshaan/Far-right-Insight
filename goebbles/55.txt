 It is astonishing, hardly believable, how the state of the
      world can change entirely within a short time. Modern war speaks
      its own language, and ideas and principles that twenty years
      ago were standard military theory and practice are now entirely
      outdated and antiquated. If one compares the world situation
      of Sunday, 7 December, the day when Japan gave President Roosevelt
      the appropriate answer to his impudent provocations and shameless
      affronts, with today, one will without doubt conclude that the
      position of the Axis powers has improved in a way that even a
      few days before military and political experts would have thought
      highly improbable.All the confident predictions of the U.S.A. and England have collapsed. 
        Those in Washington apparently thought the patience and untiring persistence 
        of Japanese negotiators were signs of weakness. They were so surprised 
        by the sudden attacking spirit of the Japanese army that they as yet have 
        found no plausible explanation for what happened. The national enthusiasm, 
        patriotic passion, and devotion of a military people have once again won 
        a great triumph, while the liberal-democratic jugglers find themselves 
        amidst the ruins of many of their vague hopes and dreams.These developments have not surprised us. We have never considered
      Japan, its army, its people and its leaders any less than they
      are today. Japan suffers from the same unsolved problems as we
      and Italy. It has no room for its growing population. The land
      suffers from a growing shortage of raw materials and economic
      prospects. Its plans for a new order in the Far East are forced
      on it by nature and its geographical and territorial situation.
      Unless it wishes to give up all claims to being a great power,
      it must follow the laws fate ordains.Clearly, Mr. Roosevelt and his plutocratic clique have never understood 
        this, and probably never will. They see the national aspirations of Japan 
        in the same way as a greedy capitalist, who would prefer to burn down 
        his factory rather than give the workers what they need to maintain a 
        basic existence  that which is absolutely necessary if they are 
        even to maintain life. Giving them what they need would be no great sacrifice 
        for the owner, but he stays firm out of principle. In relations between 
        great powers there comes a time in which negotiations are making no progress, 
        and one must turn to arms.It is characteristic of the world-famed stubborn arrogance
      of the Anglo-Saxon warmongers and arsonist clique that they entirely
      underestimated Japan’s military capacities and possibilities,
      for which they have had to pay shockingly heavy price. In London
      and Washington they presumably are rethinking the hopes they
      had even two weeks ago about America’s entry into the war. In
      any event, one senses considerable disappointment in Mr. Roosevelt’s
      and Mr. Churchill’s public statements, and the criticism of their
      remarkably foolish behavior that has found its way past the dictatorship
      of a diligent censor shows that this disappointment is also shared
      by public opinion.We certainly do not underestimate the possibilities remaining for England 
        and the United States. We have frequently said that colossuses of the 
        size of these two world powers do not fall in days, weeks, or even months. 
        We have to assume a hard and pitiless fight stands before us in which 
        there will be ups and downs, and that even we will not be able to avoid 
        some occasional setbacks. That is not decisive. What is decisive is the 
        fact that the chances of the Axis are far better, and that their leaders 
        will not hesitate to take advantage of that fact.One cannot ignore the military potential at their disposal. However, 
        a comparison with the third year of the World War is entirely false here. 
        We held firm then for four years, and lost only because of weak leadership. 
        But Germany entered the war in 1939 far better prepared than it was in 
        1914. The difficulty then was to defeat France, Britain’s traditional 
        continental ally. That we have already done. The Balkans are no threat 
        any longer. The Soviet Union has lost its offensive capacity and is no 
        longer a decisive factor in the war. Italy and Japan, two world powers 
        that opposed us in the World War, now are fighting on our side. That counts 
        twice for us, not to mention the countless spiritual and moral imponderables 
        that favor us. Altogether, the present balance of forces is wholly different 
        than it was during the World War.We hardly find it necessary today to rely on a belief in our
      national invincibility to predict that victory is certain and
      inevitable. The facts lead to that conclusion. They speak unanimously
      for us. Our figures are accurate, and if the other side proposes
      different figures they depend on bad bookkeeping.The neutral nations agree more and more. The increasing difficulties
      of civilian life, unavoidable given the duration of the war,
      will not have much influence on the war’s outcome. They are about
      the same on both sides. If a longer than normal winter means
      that potatoes come to market later than usual, it hardly means
      that they grow any faster in England because it is governed by
      plutocrats instead of National Socialists. If there are transportation
      difficulties in fall and winter that affect big cities and industrial
      areas, things are no different for the enemy. People stand in
      lines in England outside tobacco stores just as they do here.
      The fact that certain goods and luxuries are available in shops
      there is only a matter of their high price, which keeps the masses
      from purchasing them, not the upper classes. This gives the appearance
      of prosperity, but not its reality.The thing to keep in mind is that we do not consider these
      factors important to our chances of victory, while England has
      built its hopes on them. We sometimes make the mistake of seeing
      the difficulties in civilian life only here, assuming that the
      other side is living just as it did during peacetime.That is hardly the case. The fact that England is an island is a disadvantage, 
        not an advantage, given the nature of war today. From a military standpoint 
        it would be difficult for us to invade Great Britain, but it would be 
        at least as difficult, and probably more so, for England to invade Europe. 
        We have the advantage of secure rail lines. England must bring in by ship 
        everything that it cannot itself produce. Its fleet is in greater danger 
        today than ever before, as was recently proven by its defeats in the Pacific. 
        England will find it almost impossible to attack us. Its attacks on the 
        periphery, even if they succeed, will not have a significant impact on 
        the general situation. The British Isles are a prisoner of their own insularity. 
        The war will end when London understands that. Until that happens Great 
        Britain will have to suffer recurring blows before at last the fatal one 
        is struck.Japan has shown once again the enormous power in a people’s national 
        dynamics. One is deeply moved by the accounts of the heroic deeds of Japan’s 
        death-defying naval airmen. Japan knows that, like Germany and Italy, 
        it is fighting for its future, for its very life. The alliance of these 
        three great powers that despite their millennia of history retain youthful 
        vitality is natural, the result of the inescapable power of a bitter historical 
        logic. They see in this war their best chance at national existence. Their 
        leadership and their peoples know what is at stake. It is true that they 
        were forced into this war, but they are fighting it offensively, not defensively. 
        Their young men at the front burn with passion to solve the life problems 
        of their nations with weapons. Never before have they had such an opportunity 
        to test their courage, their strength, their manly readiness. They see 
        themselves affronted and insulted by plutocracy’s leaders in a way that 
        rules out any possibility of surrender. Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt 
        still have no idea what they have gotten themselves into. They may have 
        envisioned a pleasant war in which they would stroll to Berlin, Rome, 
        and Tokyo, supported by the people of countries who had been seduced by 
        their leaders. They overlooked the fact that these governments are only 
        saying and doing what their people want, even insist on or demand.There is no greater mistake than to assume a gap between these governments 
        and their people. The World War was only an intimation of coming things 
        for the oppresed nations, regardless of which side they were on. This 
        war is fought by people who know what they are doing. It is not only a 
        gigantic fight for their national honor or prestige, but also a struggle 
        for the absolute basic essentials of life, for space, work, food, and 
        life itself. It is a fight to end the eternal crises, for a radical solution 
        to the growing problems of their nations, which cannot be mastered any 
        longer within their own borders. The Axis powers have been forced to defend 
        themselves. They will do so with no sentimental looking back. They are 
        risking everything. They will not be stopped by humanitarian phrases. 
        Democratic tricks will not work here; fighting is the only way.A world determined by such factors is ever changing, as the
      events of the past two weeks demonstrate. It demands the highest
      degree of alertness and readiness. Leadership and people must
      always be on watch, ready to take advantage of any opportunity.
      The day will come when the enemy begins to crumble. No one can
      predict when that will be, but we all know that it will come.
