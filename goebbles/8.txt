The newspapers today are filled with congratulations for Reich Chancellor 
        Adolf Hitler. The nuances vary, depending on the tone, character, and 
        attitude of the newspaper. All, however, agree on one thing: Hitler is 
        a man of stature who has already accomplished historically important deeds 
        and faces still greater challenges. He is the kind of statesman found 
        only rarely in Germany. During his lifetime he has the good fortune not 
        only to be appreciated and loved by the overwhelming majority of the German 
        people, but even more importantly to be understood by them. He is the 
        only German politician of the post-war period who understood the situation 
        and drew the necessary hard and firm conclusions. All the newspapers agree 
        on this. It no longer needs to be said that he has taken up Bismarck’s 
        work and intends to complete it. There is enough proof of this even for 
        those who do not believe, or who think ill of him. I therefore do not 
        think it necessary for me to discuss the historical significance and still 
        unknown impact of this man on the eve of the day on which, far from the 
        bustle of the Reich capital, Adolf Hitler completes his 44th year. I feel 
        a much deeper need to personally express my esteem for him, and in doing 
        so I believe that I am speaking for many hundreds of thousands of National 
        Socialists thoughout the country. We shall leave it to those who were 
        our enemies only a few months ago and who then slandered then to praise 
        him today with awkward words and embarrassing pathos. We know how little 
        Adolf Hitler appreciates such attempts, and how much more the devoted 
        loyalty and lasting support of his friends and fellow fighters corresponds 
        to his nature.The mysterious magic that he exerts on all who come in contact
        
        with him cannot alone explain his historic personality. There
        
        is more that makes us love and esteem him. Through all the ups
        
        and downs of Adolf Hitler’s career, from the beginning of his
        
        political activity to the crowning of his career as he seized
        
        power, he has always remained the same: a person among people,
        
        a friend to his comrades, an eager supporter of every ability
        
        and talent. He is a pathfinder for those who devoted themselves
        
        to his idea, a man who conquered the hearts of his comrades in
        
        the midst of battle and never released them.It seems to me that one thing has to be said in the midst
        
        of the profusion of feelings. Only a few know Hitler well. Most
        
        of the millions who look to him with faithful trust do so from
        
        a distance. He has become to them a symbol of their faith in
        
        the future. Normally the great men that we admire from a distance
        
        lose their magic when one knows them well. With Hitler the opposite
        
        is true. The longer one knows him the more one admires him,
        
        and the more one is ready to give oneself fully to his cause.We will let others blow the trumpets. His friends and comrades
        
        gather round him to shake his hand and thank him for everything
        
        that he is to us, and that he has given to us. Let me say it
        
        once more: We love this man and we know that he has earned all
        
        of our love and support. Never was a man more unjustly accused
        
        by the hate and slanders of his ill-wishers of other parties.
        
        Remember what they said about him! A mishmash of contradictory
        
        accusations! They did not fail to accuse him of every sin, to deny him every virtue. When he nonetheless overcame in the
        
        end the flood of lies, triumphing over his enemies and raising
        
        the National Socialist flag over Germany, fate showed its favor
        
        toward him to the entire world. It raised him from the mass of
        
        people and put him in the place he deserved because of his brilliant
        
        gifts and his pure and flawless humanity.I remember the years when  just released from prison  he 
        began to rebuild his party. We passed a few wonderful vacation days with 
        him on his beloved Obersalzburg high above Berchtesgaden. Below us was 
        the quiet cemetery where his unforgettable friend Dietrich Eckart is buried. 
        We walked through the mountains, discussed plans for the future, and talked 
        about theories that today have long since become reality. He then sent 
        me to Berlin. He gave me a difficult and challenging task, and I still 
        thank him today that he gave me the job.A few months later we sat in a room in a small Berlin hotel.
        
        The party had just been banned by the Marxist-Jewish police department.
        
        Heavy blows were falling on it. The party was full of discouragement,
        
        bickering and quarreling. Everyone was complaining about everyone
        
        else. The whole organization seemed to have given up.Hitler, however, did not lose courage, but immediately began to organize 
        a defense and helped out where he was needed. Although he had his own 
        personal and political difficulties, he found the time and strength to 
        deal with the problems and support his friends in the Reich capital.One of his fine and noble traits is that he never gives up
        
        on someone who has won his confidence. The more his political
        
        opponents attack such a person, the more loyal is Adolf Hitler’s
        
        support. He is not the kind of person who is afraid of strong
        
        associates. The harder and tougher a man is, the more Hitler
        
        likes him. If things fall apart, his capable hands put them together
        
        again. Who would have thought it possible that a mass organization
        
        that includes literally everything could be build in this nation
        
        of individualists? Doing that is Hitler’s great accomplishment.
        
        His principles are firm and unshakable, but he is generous and
        
        understanding toward human weaknesses. He is a pitiless enemy
        
        of his opponents, but a good and warm-hearted friend to his comrades.
        
        That is Hitler.We saw him at the party’s two large Nuremberg rallies, surrounded
        
        by the masses who saw in him Germany’s hope. In the evenings,
        
        we sat with him in his hotel room. He was dressed in a simple
        
        brown shirt, the same as always, as if nothing had happened.
        
        Someone once said that the great is simple, and the simple is
        
        great. If that is true, it surely applies to Hitler. His 
        
        nature and his whole philosophy is a brilliant simplification
        
        of the spiritual need and fragmentation that engulfed the German
        
        people after the war. He found the lowest common denominator.
        
        That is why  his idea won: he modeled it, and through him
        
        the average man in the street saw its depth and significance.One has to have seen him in defeat as well as victory to understand
        
        what sort of man he is. He never broke. He never lost courage
        
        or faith. Hundreds came to him seeking new hope, and no one left
        
        without receiving renewed strength.On the day before 13 August 1932, we met in a small farm house outside 
        Potsdam. We talked deep into the night, but not about our prospects for 
        the next day, but rather about music, philosophy, and worldview issues. Then 
        came the experiences one can only have with him. He spoke of the difficult 
        years of his youth in Vienna and Munich, of his war experiences, of first 
        years of the party. Few know how hard and bitterly he had to fight. Today 
        he is surrounded by praise and thanks. Only fifteen years ago he was a 
        lonely individual among millions. The only difference between him and 
        they was his burning faith and his fanatic resolve to transform that faith 
        into action.Those who believed that Hitler was finished after the party’s
        
        defeat in November 1932 failed to understand him. Only someone
        
        who did not know him at all could make such a mistake. Hitler
        
        is one of those persons who rises from his defeats. Friedrich
        
        Nietzsche’s phrase fits him well: “That which does not destroy
        
        me only makes me stronger.”This man, suffering under financial and party problems for
        
        years, assailed by the flood of lies from his enemies, wounded
        
        in the depths of his heart by the disloyalty of false friends,
        
        still found the limitless faith to lift his party from desperation
        
        to new victories.How many thousands of kilometers have I sat behind him in cars or airplanes 
        on election campaigns. How often did I see the thankful look of a man 
        on the street, or a mother lifting her child to show him, and how often 
        have I seen joy and happiness when people recognized him.He kept his pockets filled with packages of cigarettes, each
        
        with a one or two mark coin. Every working lad he met got one.
        
        He had a friendly word for every mother and a warm handshake
        
        for every child.Not without reason does the German youth admire him. They know that this 
        man is young at heart and that their cause is in his good hands. Last 
        Easter Monday we sat with him in his small house on the Obersalzberg. 
        A group of young hikers from Braunau, where he was born, came by for a 
        visit. How surprised these lads were when they got not only a friendly 
        greeting, but all fifteen lads were invited in. They got a hurriedly prepared 
        lunch and had to tell him about his hometown of Braunau.The people have a fine sense for the truly great. Nothing impresses the 
        people as deeply as when a person truly belongs to his people. Of whom 
        but Hitler could this be true: As he returned from Berchtesgaden to Munich, 
        people waved in every village. The children shouted Heil and threw bouquets 
        of flowers into the car. The S.A. had closed the road in Traunstein. There 
        was no moving either forward or back. Confidently and matter-of-factly, 
        the S.A. Führer walked up to the car and said: “My Führer, 
        an old party member is dying in the hospital and his last wish is to 
        see his Führer.”Mountains of work were waiting in Munich. But Hitler ordered
        
        the car to turn around and sat for half an hour in the hospital
        
        at the bedside of his dying party comrade.The Marxist press claimed he was a tyrant who dominated his
        
        satraps. What is he really? He is the best friend of his comrades.
        
        He has an open heart for every sorrow and every need, he has
        
        human understanding. He knows each of his associates thoroughly
        
        and nothing happens in their public or private lives of which
        
        he is not aware. If misfortune happens, he helps them to bear
        
        it, and rejoices more than anyone else at their successes.Never have I seen his two sides in anyone else. We had dinner
        
        together on the night of the Reichstag fire. We talked and listened
        
        to music. Hitler was a person among people. Twenty minutes later
        
        he stood in the smoldering, smoking ruins of the Reichstag building
        
        and gave piercing orders that led to the destruction of communism.
        
        Later he sat in an editorial office and dictated an article.For those who do not know Hitler, it seems a miracle that
        
        millions of people love and support him. For those who know him,
        
        it is only natural. The secret of his success is in the indescribable
        
        magic of his personality. Those who know him the best love and
        
        honor him the most. One who has sworn allegiance to him is devoted
        
        to him body and soul.I thought it was necessary tonight to say that, and to have it said by 
        someone who really knows him, and who could find the courage to break 
        through the barriers of reserve and speak of Hitler the man.Today he has left the bustle of the capital. He left the wreaths and 
        hymns of praise in Berlin. He is somewhere in his beloved Bavaria, far 
        from the noise of the streets, to find peace and quiet. Perhaps in a nearby 
        room someone will turn on a loudspeaker. If that should happen, then let 
        me say to him, and to all of Germany: My Führer! Millions and millions 
        of the best Germans send you their best wishes and give you their hearts. 
        And we, your closest associates and friends, are gathered in honor and 
        love. We know how little you like praise. But we must still say this: 
        You have lifted Germany from its deepest disgrace to honor and dignity. 
        You should know that behind you, and if necessary before you, a strong 
        and determined group of fighters stands that is ready at any time to give 
        its all for you and your idea. We wish both for your sake and ours that 
        fate will preserve you for many decades, and that you may always remain 
        our best friend and comrade. This is the wish of your fellow fighters 
        and friends for your birthday. We offer your our hands and ask that you 
        always remain for us what you are today:Our Hitler!
