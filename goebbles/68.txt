 We Germans are still a young nation, with the virtues and weaknesses 
        as well as the advantages and disadvantages of youth. Our national sense 
        is a recent development, and still under attack. We identified too long 
        with our tribal origins for our sense of nationhood to be self-evident. 
        In England a statement like “My country  right or wrong!” 
        is an incontestable principle of public life, but it is still difficult 
        for us Germans.We have a highly developed individual sense of justice, indeed

      we suffer from a kind of super-objectivity that mostly benefits

      our worst enemies and harms our own interests. An appeal to our

      decency always works, and we do not think too much about whether

      it is honestly intended or only exploits our good nature. Were

      one to leave the German people without clear leadership for a

      few years, it would soon return to being a colorful conglomerate

      of individuals. Nothing is more characteristic of our national

      character than that many millions of German-Americans maintain

      their social connections in bowling clubs, singing groups, and

      homeland associations, but soon lose their patriotic feelings.National Socialism gave us Germans a kind of national consciousness for 
        the first time. It gave at least a part of today’s generation a sense 
        of what it means to be a people. But that feeling is still so young and 
        fragile that we must always guard it.Our enemies know that better than we do and use it in their

      propaganda. One can hardly imagine another nation falling prey

      to such a grotesque bluff as we fell for in 1918. We could not

      imagine that our enemies did not have the same ideas and concepts

      as we do. We believed their phrases of world brotherhood, and

      it took years before we saw through the swindle. And we Germans

      are not the kind of people with long memories. Indeed, we love

      to extend our sympathies to other nations that do not even want

      it. Even Versailles did not keep us from thinking the French

      were our friends within a few years, and not even this war, instigated

      not only in London but in Paris and directed against our very

      existence, has had an impact on our friendly attitudes toward

      the French.One cannot imagine what our people would do with a government

      that practices swindles on such a scale as Mr. Churchill’s in

      England. Yet there are people among us who see some sort of political

      style in it. It does not concern them in the least that it is

      directed entirely against us and that it is the real cause of

      the troubles and concerns of the war. We are so afraid of doing

      an injustice to others that we prefer when uncertain to do ourselves

      an injustice. One really cannot maintain that the German leadership

      has made many mistakes in this war. By and large we have always

      analyzed the situation accurately. Still there are those among

      us who work to forget everything we have predicted that came

      to pass and with the same energy remember those cases, and repeat

      them incessantly, in which we supposedly made a mistake.No one will say that is fair. It is even more distressing,

      however, when these same people grant a kind of super-correctness

      to the enemy that is entirely out of place. They find any sign

      of self-interest on our side objectionable, while viewing the

      most primitive demagogy on the other side as originality. It

      really does not take all that much intelligence to see through

      Mr. Churchill’s tricks. He certainly has demagogic abilities

      of the highest order. But that is all he has. We find it an insult

      to compare him with the Führer. One cannot imagine that

      the English would grant the Führer any trace of justice

      at all, even though all that he is and has accomplished is the

      result of his own efforts, though he lives a life of almost legendary

      simplicity, and has shaken the entire world with his ideas. The

      English are saving their sentimentality for after the war, when

      it will not cost them anything.We are different. If one of our newspapers says something

      crude about a statesman on the enemy side (the kind of expressions,

      by the way, that are common every day even in the serious British

      papers), the German sense of justice is suddenly awakened and

      our Michel feels the need to protect this statesman, to point

      out his good sides, and to defend his weaknesses.We Germans must still learn to hate. We do not incline to

      chauvinism, and when one wants to heat up our national soul he

      must proceed carefully. There are supposedly even German soldiers

      who, after marching 1000 kilometers through the horror and spiritual

      desolation of the Eastern wilderness discover somewhere an atlas

      in a village school. They ponder it and ask doubtfully if perhaps

      there may not be something to Bolshevism after all.The English destroyed a whole valuable ancient culture in India, and 
        never even thought about studying its history and values. They are English, 
        after all. They think that the world was created for the English, while 
        we think that we Germans were created to serve the world. That is the 
        difference between us. It is certainly the case that the British standpoint 
        is better suited for practical political life, and that we are always 
        at a disadvantage. Many of us would hardly want to have those English 
        characteristics, but that does not stop us from admiring the English. 
        The English find it obvious that one speaks English with them. We would 
        hardly expect a foreigner to speak German. We break our heads learning 
        French or English and look for Americans to explain the mysteries of slang 
        to us so as not to inconvenience them by speaking proper English.Are these traits appreciated? Not at all! These German traits

      are held in contempt rather than admiration. Certain people who

      spent six months in England before the war thought it their duty

      upon returning home to add an English accent to their speech.

      They wanted English clothing, ate English, drank five o’clock

      tea instead of coffee, did not use their umbrella even when it

      rained, regardless of the grins of their fellow countrymen, and

      sneered at the homeland from which they came but which they tried

      to forget as soon as they encountered a different world.We Germans still have a lot to learn if we finally want to

      come out ahead spiritually and socially. Some of us, particularly

      those proud of their good education and breeding, suffer a sudden

      inferiority complex abroad. They behave as if they always need

      to apologize, looking like someone attending a formal dinner

      for the first time who is not sure which utensil to use for the

      fish. We are wholly free of such an inferiority complex, and

      can therefore speak about it openly. When before the war some

      English or American journalist came to us and impudently asked

      whether we understood English, we did not feel distressed and

      embarrassed, but rather told the boor in German that even if we could

      speak English, we would not speak it with him, and showed him

      the door. He usually got the idea.We do not want to be misunderstood. We certainly do not underestimate 
        the enemy. The best way to avoid that is to know him and study him. We 
        realize that England is not a nation of devils. They have admirable characteristics. 
        But we will not speak of them as long as they see no good in us. And there 
        is a war on. We hate them from the bottom of our souls because they threaten 
        our very life, because they oppose our national existence out of envy, 
        jealousy, and ill-concealed national pride.Why are we fairer to them than they are to us? We are fighting

      the war according to purely pragmatic principles. We do not want

      a second catastrophe along the lines of 1918. We depend not on

      the grace of our enemy, but rather on military might. That has nothing

      to do with objectivity. We easily reject the charge that we are

      prejudiced. We are not interested in a purely objective decision

      when our very existence, our very life is at stake. We are on

      our side, prejudiced, stubborn and selfish in this regard. Do

      not tell us that is not German. It may be that the opposite is

      German, but if so it is a bad and dangerous side of our national

      character that we must fight. Should we be so objective and fair

      that in the end we do ourselves an injustice? Even Klopstock

      assailed this German national weakness when he told our people

      not to be too fair, for our enemies are not noble enough to see

      how lovely a mistake that is.Lovely or not, it is a mistake. Over our history it has done us more 
        damage than we can bear. Our present situation is indeed a consequence 
        of it. At vital moments in our history, we have lacked sufficient national 
        egotism to enable us to rise above objectivity and fairness to give full 
        service to our national interest, undeterred by any false sentimentality. 
        If the German people suddenly became leaderless today, they probably would 
        wander around the world as so often in the past spreading morals, culture, 
        civilization, and education, but entirely forgetting to bring food and 
        fuel along. The German people are the heart of humanity, and our mission 
        today is to give it a broad foundation for its existence. That is an ideal, 
        but a realistic one worthy of the greatest sacrifices.If we once again stood with empty hands at the end of the war, we should 
        be ashamed before the mothers who lost their sons, the children who lost 
        the fathers, and the women who lost their husbands. We therefore warn 
        against any danger we see, and particularly against those with roots in 
        our national character. The bourgeois era with its false and lying idea 
        of humanitarianism is over. We are in the middle of a hard century. It 
        will be won not by good nature, but by manliness and strength. The world 
        is divided by love and hate. To be on firm ground, one must know whom 
        to love and whom to hate.There is only one thing that is objectively incontestable

      for us: We must win. That must guide us!
